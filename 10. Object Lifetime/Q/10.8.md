10.8 Given the following class, which instance initializer block inserted independently at (1) will allow the class to be compiled?

```java
public class FirstClass {
    static int gap = 10;
    double length;
    final boolean active;

    // (1) INSERT CODE HERE
}
```

Select the one correct answer.

- instance { active = true; }

- FirstClass { gap += 5; }

- { gap = 5; length = (active ? 100 : 200) + gap; }

- { }

- { length = 4.2; }

- { active = (gap > 5); length = 5.5 + gap;}

To determine which instance initializer block can be independently inserted at (1) in the given code, let's analyze each option:

1. `instance { active = true; }`
This option is not valid because the `active` variable is marked as `final`, meaning its value cannot be changed after initialization. Therefore, this initializer block cannot be inserted at (1).

2. `FirstClass { gap += 5; }`
This option is not valid because it doesn't follow the correct syntax for an instance initializer block. It attempts to use a constructor-like syntax, which is incorrect for an initializer block. Therefore, this initializer block cannot be inserted at (1).

3. `{ gap = 5; length = (active ? 100 : 200) + gap; }`
This option is valid and can be inserted at (1). It initializes the `gap` variable to `5` and assigns a value to the `length` variable based on the value of `active`. The `active` variable itself is not directly initialized in this block, but it can be assigned a value in other parts of the code.

4. `{ }`
This option is valid but doesn't perform any initialization. It is an empty initializer block and can be inserted at (1) if no initialization is required.

5. `{ length = 4.2; }`
`{ length = 4.2; }` is not a valid initializer block and cannot be independently inserted at (1). 

The reason is that the `length` variable is an `instance variable`, and its initialization should be done either at the `point of declaration` or in the `constructor`. 

`Instance initializer blocks` are used to initialize `instance variables` and run `before` the constructor is executed. 

However, in this case, the `length` variable is already declared without an initializer, and it is not appropriate to initialize it in an instance initializer block. 


6. `{ active = (gap > 5); length = 5.5 + gap; }`
This option is not valid because it attempts to assign a value to the `active` variable, which is marked as `final`. It also uses the `gap` variable, which is not yet assigned a value. Therefore, this initializer block cannot be inserted at (1).

Based on the analysis above, the correct answer is:

`{ gap = 5; length = (active ? 100 : 200) + gap; }`
