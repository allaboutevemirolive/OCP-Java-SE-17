10.6 Given the following class, which of these static initializer blocks can be independently inserted at (1)?

```java
public class MyClass {
    private static int count = 5;
    static final int STEP = 10;
    boolean alive;

    // (1) INSERT STATIC INITIALIZER BLOCK HERE
}
```

Select the three correct answers.

- static { alive = true; count = 0; }

- static { STEP = count; }

- static { count += STEP; }

- static ;

- static { }

- static { count = 1; }

To determine which static initializer blocks can be independently inserted at (1) in the given code, let's analyze each option:

1. `static { alive = true; count = 0; }`
This initializer block sets the `alive` variable to `true` and `count` to `0`. It is valid and can be inserted at (1). It initializes the static variables `alive` and `count`.

2. `static { STEP = count; }`
This initializer block attempts to assign the value of `count` to `STEP`, but `STEP` is declared as `final`, which means its value cannot be changed once assigned. Therefore, this initializer block is not valid and cannot be inserted at (1).

3. `static { count += STEP; }`
This initializer block attempts to increment the `count` variable by the value of `STEP`. Since `STEP` is a `final` variable with a value of `10`, this block is valid and can be inserted at (1). It increments the `count` by `10`.

4. `static ;`
This is an empty static initializer block, which doesn't contain any statements. It is `valid` but `doesn't perform any initialization`. Therefore, it is not useful in this context, and it cannot be inserted at (1).

5. `static { }`
This is also an empty static initializer block with no statements. Similar to the previous option, it doesn't perform any initialization and is not useful in this context. Hence, it cannot be inserted at (1).

6. `static { count = 1; }`
This initializer block sets the `count` variable to `1`. It is valid and can be inserted at (1), initializing the `count` to `1`.

Based on the analysis above, the three correct answers are:

- `static { alive = true; count = 0; }`
- `static { count += STEP; }`
- `static { count = 1; }`
