10.2 Identify the location in the following program where the object, initially referenced by arg1, is eligible for garbage collection.
```java
public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String msg;
        String pre = "This program was called with ";
        String post = " as first argument.";
        String arg1 = new String((args.length > 0) ? "'" + args[0] + "'" : "<no argument>");
    
        msg = arg1;
        arg1 = null;             // (1)
        msg = pre + msg + post;  // (2)
        pre = null;              // (3)
        System.out.println(msg);
        msg = null;              // (4)
        post = null;             // (5)
        args = null;             // (6)
    }
}
```

Based on the provided program, the location where the object referenced by `arg1` becomes eligible for garbage collection is `after the line at (1)`.

Here's the breakdown of the program's execution:

1. A new `String` object is created and assigned to the variable `arg1`.
2. The `msg` variable is assigned the value of `arg1`.
3. The `arg1` variable is set to `null`, meaning it no longer references the `String` object.
4. The `msg` variable is assigned a new value concatenating `pre`, `msg`, and `post`.
5. The `pre` variable is set to `null`, meaning it no longer references the original `String` object created in line (2).
6. The `msg` variable is set to `null`, meaning it no longer references the concatenated `String` object.
7. The `post` variable is set to `null`, meaning it no longer references the original `String` object created in line (2).
8. The `args` variable is set to `null`, but it is not relevant to the object initially referenced by `arg1`.

After the line at (1), `arg1` is set to `null`, so it no longer holds a reference to the initial `String` object. This means that the object becomes eligible for garbage collection at that point.

Therefore, the correct answer is: After the line at (1).
