10.9 What will be the result of compiling and running the following program?

```java
public class Initialization {
    private static String msg(String msg) {
        System.out.println(msg);
        return msg;
    }

    public Initialization() {  // constructor
        m = msg("1"); 
    }

    {   
        m = msg("2");          // instance initializer block
    }

    String m = msg("3");       // instance variable

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object obj = new Initialization();
    }
}
```
Select the one correct answer.

- The program will fail to compile.

- The program will compile and print 1, 2, and 3 at runtime.

- The program will compile and print 2, 3, and 1 at runtime.

- The program will compile and print 3, 1, and 2 at runtime.

- The program will compile and print 1, 3, and 2 at runtime.

The correct answer is:

The program will compile and print `1, 2, and 3` at runtime.

Explanation:

1. The code defines a class named `Initialization` with the following members:
   - A private static method `msg(String msg)` that prints the given message and returns it.
   - A constructor `Initialization()` that invokes the `msg()` method with the argument `"1"` and assigns the returned value to the instance variable `m`.
   - An instance initializer block that assigns the result of invoking `msg()` with the argument `"2"` to the instance variable `m`.
   - An instance variable `m` that is initialized with the result of invoking `msg()` with the argument `"3"`.
   - The `main()` method that creates an instance of `Initialization` and assigns it to an `Object` variable `obj`.

2. During the initialization of the `Initialization` object, the following steps occur:
   - The instance variable `m` is declared, but its initialization is deferred until later.
   - The instance initializer block is executed, which invokes `msg()` with the argument `"2"`. This causes `"2"` to be printed.
   - The instance variable `m` is assigned the returned value from the previous step, which is `"2"`.
   - The instance variable `m` is then re-assigned when the constructor is called, invoking `msg()` with the argument `"1"`. This causes `"1"` to be printed.
   - The instance variable `m` is assigned the returned value from the previous step, which is `"1"`.

3. In the `main()` method, an instance of `Initialization` is created and assigned to the `Object` variable `obj`.

4. When the code is executed, it will print `"1"`, `"2"`, and `"3"` in that order. This output reflects the sequence of invocations of the `msg()` method during initialization.

Therefore, the correct output is:

```
1
2
3
```

This output is achieved because the constructor is called last in the initialization process, after the instance initializer block and instance variable initialization.
