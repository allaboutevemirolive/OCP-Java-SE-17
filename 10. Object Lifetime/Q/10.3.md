10.3 How many objects are eligible for garbage collection when control reaches (1)?

```java
public class Elements {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = new int[4];

        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            array[i] = i;
        }

        array[0] = array[1] = array[2] = array[3] = 0;
        System.gc();  // (1);
    }
}
```
Select the one correct answer.

- 0

- 1

- 4

- Itâ€™s hard to say.

Based on the provided code, when control reaches the line marked with (1), there are no objects eligible for garbage collection.

Here's the breakdown of the code execution:

1. An array of integers (`array`) with a size of 4 is created.
2. The `for` loop assigns values to each element of the `array` in a sequential manner.
3. The following line sets all elements of the `array` to 0: `array[0] = array[1] = array[2] = array[3] = 0;`
4. The `System.gc()` method is called, suggesting a request to the JVM for garbage collection.

At the point where control reaches (1), there are no objects that have become unreachable or are no longer referenced. The `array` object is still in scope and accessible.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 0.
