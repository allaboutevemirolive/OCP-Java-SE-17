10.1 Which of the following statements is true?
Select the one correct answer.

- Objects can be explicitly destroyed using the keyword delete.

- An object will be garbage collected immediately after it becomes unreachable.

- If object obj1 is accessible from object obj2, and object obj2 is accessible from obj1, then obj1 and obj2 are not eligible for garbage collection.

- If object obj1 can access object obj2 that is eligible for garbage collection, then obj1 is also eligible for garbage collection.


___

The correct answer to question 10.1 from OCP Java SE 17 is:

- If object obj1 can access object obj2 that is eligible for garbage collection, then obj1 is also eligible for garbage collection.

In Java, an object becomes eligible for garbage collection when it is no longer reachable from any active references in the program. 

If an object obj1 can access another object obj2 that is eligible for garbage collection, it does not prevent obj1 from being eligible for garbage collection as well. 

The eligibility for garbage collection is determined based on the reachability of each individual object, not on the mutual accessibility between objects.

Tell me why the remaining answers are incorrect.

Sure! Let's go through each of the remaining answer choices and explain why they are incorrect:

1. Objects can be explicitly destroyed using the keyword delete.
   - This statement is incorrect. In Java, objects are automatically garbage collected by the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) when they are no longer reachable. There is no keyword "delete" in Java to explicitly destroy objects.

2. An object will be garbage collected immediately after it becomes unreachable.
   - This statement is incorrect. While an object becomes eligible for garbage collection when it is no longer reachable, the actual garbage collection process is not immediate. The JVM's garbage collector runs at its own discretion and performs garbage collection when it determines it is necessary based on factors like memory pressure and allocation thresholds.

3. If object obj1 is accessible from object obj2, and object obj2 is accessible from obj1, then obj1 and obj2 are not eligible for garbage collection.
   - This statement is incorrect. Circular references, where object obj1 references obj2 and obj2 references obj1, can still be eligible for garbage collection if they are not reachable from any other active references in the program. The JVM's garbage collector can identify and collect objects with circular references as long as they are not part of any reachable object graph.

Therefore, the correct answer is the fourth option:
If object obj1 can access object obj2 that is eligible for garbage collection, then obj1 is also eligible for garbage collection.
