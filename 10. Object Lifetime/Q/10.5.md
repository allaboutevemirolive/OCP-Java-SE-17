        new Song(),
        new Song()
    };
    public Song[] getSongs() {
        return songs;
    }

    public void removeAll() {
        songs = null;
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Album album = new Album();
        Song[] songs = album.getSongs();
        album.removeAll();

___

Based on the provided code, when control reaches line (1), there are 2 objects eligible for garbage collection.

Here's the breakdown of the code execution:

1. The `Song` class is defined.
2. The `Album` class is defined, which has a private `songs` array of `Song` objects.
3. The `Album` class has a `getSongs()` method that returns the `songs` array.
4. The `Album` class has a `removeAll()` method that sets the `songs` array to `null`.
5. The `Test` class is defined with the `main` method.
6. In the `main` method, an `Album` object is created and assigned to the `album` variable.
7. The `getSongs()` method is called on the `album` object, and the returned `songs` array is assigned to the `songs` variable.
8. The `removeAll()` method is called on the `album` object, which sets the `songs` array to `null`.
9. The `System.out.println()` method is called, attempting to print the `songs` array from the `album` object.
10. Control reaches line (1).

When control reaches line (1), the `songs` array inside the `album` object has been set to `null` in the `removeAll()` method. The array objects previously referenced by the `songs` array are no longer accessible from the `album` object.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 2.
