10.4 How many objects are eligible for garbage collection when control reaches (1)?

```java
public class Link {
    private Link next;
    Link(Link next) { this.next = next; }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Link p = null;
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            p = new Link(p);
        }
        System.gc();            // (1)
    }
}
```

Based on the provided code, when control reaches the line marked with (1), there are `5` objects eligible for garbage collection.

Here's the breakdown of the code execution:

1. The `Link` class is defined with a private `next` reference.
2. In the `main` method, the `p` variable is declared and initialized to `null`.
3. The `for` loop iterates 5 times:
   - Inside the loop, a new `Link` object is created with the previous `p` object passed as the `next` reference.
   - The newly created `Link` object is assigned to the `p` variable.
4. After the loop, there are 5 `Link` objects created, forming a chain with each object referencing the previous one.
5. The `System.gc()` method is called, suggesting a request to the JVM for garbage collection.

When control reaches (1), the `p` variable holds a reference to the last `Link` object created in the loop. All the other `Link` objects created in the loop are not directly accessible from the `p` variable or any other active reference.

Therefore, the correct answer is: 5.
