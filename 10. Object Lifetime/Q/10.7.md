10.7 What will be the result of compiling and running the following program?

```java
public class MyClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyClass obj = new MyClass(n);
    }

    static int i = 5;
    static int n;
    int j = 7;
    int k;

    public MyClass(int m) {
        System.out.println(i + ", " + j + ", " + k + ", " + n + ", " + m);
    } {      // Instance initializer block
        j = 70;
        n = 20;
    } 
    static { // Static initializer block
        i = 50;
    } 
}
```
Select the one correct answer.

- The code will fail to compile because of the instance initializer block.

- The code will fail to compile because of the static initializer block.

- The code will compile and print 50, 70, 0, 20, 0 at runtime.

- The code will compile and print 50, 70, 0, 20, 20 at runtime.

- The code will compile and print 5, 70, 0, 20, 0 at runtime.

- The code will compile and print 5, 70, 0, 20, 20 at runtime.

- The code will compile and print 5, 7, 0, 20, 0 at runtime.

- The code will compile and print 5, 7, 0, 20, 20 at runtime.

The correct answer is:

The code will compile and print `50, 70, 0, 20, 0` at runtime.

Explanation:

1. The code defines a class named `MyClass` with the following members:

- Two static variables: `i` initialized to `5` and `n` not explicitly initialized.
- Two instance variables: `j` initialized to `7` and `k` not explicitly initialized.
- A constructor `MyClass(int m)` that prints the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, and `m`.
- An instance initializer block that sets the value of `j` to `70` and `n` to `20`.
- A static initializer block that sets the value of `i` to `50`.

2. In the `main` method, an instance of `MyClass` is created and assigned to the variable `obj`. The constructor `MyClass(int m)` is called with an undefined variable `n`.

3. During the initialization of the `MyClass` instance, the instance initializer block is executed, setting `j` to `70` and `n` to `20`.

4. Then, the constructor is called with the value of `m` passed as the undefined variable `n`. Inside the constructor, the values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `n`, and `m` are printed.

Based on the initialization order, here's the breakdown of the values:

- `i` is initialized to `50` in the static initializer block.
- `j` is initialized to `7` during instance initialization but later updated to `70` in the instance initializer block.
- `k` is not explicitly initialized and remains `0`.
- `n` is set to `20` in the instance initializer block.
- `m` is the parameter passed to the constructor and is undefined in the `main` method.

Therefore, when the code is executed, it will print:

`50, 70, 0, 20, 0`

This output reflects the values of the variables at runtime after the initialization process.
