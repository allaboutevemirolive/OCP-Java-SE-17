## 10.8 `instance initializer blocks`

Just as `static initializer blocks` can be used to initialize `static fields` in a named class, Java provides the ability to initialize `fields` during object creation using `instance initializer blocks`.

In this respect, such blocks serve the same purpose as `constructors` during object creation.

The syntax of an `instance initializer block` is the same as that of a `local block`, as shown at (2) in the following code.

The code in the `local block` is executed every time an instance of the class is created.

```java
class InstanceInitializers {
    long[] squares = new long[10]; // (1)
    // ...
    { // (2) Instance Initializer
        for (int i = 0; i < squares.length; i++)
            squares[i] = i * i;
    }
    // ...
}
```
The array squares of specified length is first created at (1); its creation is followed by the execution of the `instance initializer block` at (2) every time an instance of the class `InstanceInitializers` is created.

Note that the `instance initializer block` is `not` contained in any method.

A class can have more than one `instance initializer block`, and these (and any `instance initializer expressions` in `instance field` declarations) are executed in the order they are specified in the class.

## Declaration Order of Instance Initializers

Analogous to the other initializers discussed earlier, an `instance initializer block` cannot make a `forward reference` to a field by its simple name in a read operation as that would violate the `declaration-before-reading` rule.

However, using the `this` keyword to access a field is not a problem.

The class below has an `instance initializer block` at (1) with `forward references` to the fields i, j, and k that are declared at (7), (8), and (9), respectively.

These fields are accessed using the `this` reference in read operations at (3), (4), (5), and (6).

Using the `simple name` of these fields at (3), (4), (5), and (6) to access their values will violate the `declare-before-use` rule, resulting in compile-time errors—regardless of whether the fields are declared with `initializer expressions` or not, or whether they are `final` or not.

The fields i and j are accessed at (2) in write operations, which are permitted using the simple name.

However, care must be exercised to ensure that the fields are initialized correctly.

At (3), (4), and (5), the fields i and j have the value 10.

However, when the `initializer expressions` are evaluated in the `instance field` declarations, the value of j will be set to 100.

```java
public class InstanceInitializersII {

    { //Instance initializer with forward references. (1)
        i = j = 10;                                // (2) Permitted.
        int result = this.i * this.j;              // (3) i is 10, j is 10.
        System.out.println(this.i);                // (4) 10
        System.out.println(this.j);                // (5) 10
        System.out.println(this.k);                // (6) 50
    }
    // Instance field declarations.

    int i; // (7) Field declaration without initializer expression.

    int j = 100; // (8) Field declaration with initializer expression.

    final int k = 50; // (9) Final instance field with constant expression.

}
```
Example 10.6 illustrates some additional subtle points regarding `instance initializer blocks`.

In Example 10.6, an `illegal` `forward reference` occurs in the code at (4), which attempts to read the value of the field `nsf1` before it is declared.

The read operation at (11) occurs after the declaration, and therefore, is allowed.

`Forward reference` made on the `left-hand side` of the assignment is always allowed, as shown at (2), (3), (5), and (7).

Declaring local variables using the reserved word `var` in `instance initializer blocks` is shown at (5) and (12) in Example 10.6.

Example 10.6 `Instance Initializers` and `Forward References`

```java
public class NonStaticForwardReferences {

    {                          // (1) `instance initializer block`.
        nsf1 = 10;             // (2) OK. Assignment to nsf1 allowed.
        nsf1 = sf1;            // (3) OK. Static field access in non-static context.
        //  int a = 2 * nsf1;  // (4) Not OK. Read operation before declaration.
        var b = nsf1 = 20;     // (5) OK. Assignment to nsf1 allowed.
        int c = this.nsf1;     // (6) OK. Not accessed by simple name.
    }

    int nsf1 = nsf2 = 30; // (7) Non-static field. Assignment to nsf2 allowed.
    int nsf2;             // (8) Non-static field.
    static int sf1 = 5;   // (9) Static field.

    {                      // (10) `instance initializer block`.
        int d = 2 * nsf1;  // (11) OK. Read operation after declaration.
        var e = nsf1 = 50; // (12) OK. Assignment to nsf1 allowed.
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NonStaticForwardReferences objRef = new NonStaticForwardReferences();
        System.out.println("nsf1: " + objRef.nsf1);
        System.out.println("nsf2: " + objRef.nsf2);
    }
```
```
Output from the program:

nsf1: 50
nsf2: 30
```

As in an `instance initializer expression`, the keywords `this` and `super` can be used to refer to the current object in an `instance initializer block`.

As in a `static initializer block`, the `return` statement is also not allowed in `instance initializer blocks`.

An `instance initializer block` can be used to factor out common initialization code that will be executed regardless of which `constructor` is invoked.

A typical usage of an `instance initializer block` is in `anonymous` classes (§9.6, p.521), which cannot declare `constructors`, but can instead use `instance initializer blocks` to initialize `fields`.

In Example 10.7, the anonymous class defined at (1) uses an `instance initializer block` at (2) to initialize its `fields`.

Example 10.7 `instance initializer block` in `Anonymous Class`


```java
// File: InstanceInitBlock.java
class Base {
    protected int a;
    protected int b;
    void print() {
        System.out.println("a: " + a);
    }
}

class AnonymousClassMaker {
    Base createAnonymous() {
        return new Base() { // (1) Anonymous class
            {               // (2) Instance initializer
                a = 5;
                b = 10;
            }

            @Override
            void print() {
                super.print();
                System.out.println("b: " + b);
            }
        }; // end anonymous class
    }
}

public class InstanceInitBlock {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new AnonymousClassMaker().createAnonymous().print();
    }
}
```
```
Output from the program:
a: 5
b: 10
```

## Exception Handling and `instance initializer blocks`

Exception handling in `instance initializer blocks` is similar to that in `static initializer blocks`.

Example 10.8 shows an `instance initializer block` at (3) that catches and handles a checked exception in the `try-catch` block at (4).

Another `instance initializer block` at (5) throws an unchecked exception at (6).

The runtime system handles the runtime exception, printing the stack trace and terminating the program.

Exception handling in `instance initializer blocks` differs from that in `static initializer blocks` in the following aspect: 

  - The execution of an `instance initializer block` can result in an `uncaught checked exception` being thrown, 
      
  - provided the exception is declared in the throws clause of every `constructor` in the class.

`Static initializer blocks` cannot allow this, since no constructors are involved in class initialization.

`Instance initializer blocks` in anonymous classes have even greater freedom: 
  - They can throw any exception.

Example 10.8 `Exception Handling` in `instance initializer blocks`

```java
// File: ExceptionsInInstBlocks.java

class RoomOccupancyTooHighException
      extends Exception {}                       // (1) Checked exception
class BankruptcyException
      extends RuntimeException {}                // (2) Unchecked exception

class Hotel {
    // Instance Members
    private boolean bankrupt         = true;
    private int     noOfRooms        = 215;
    private int     occupancyPerRoom = 5;
    private int     maxNoOfGuests;

    {                                            // (3) Instance initializer block
        try {                                    // (4) Handles checked exception
            if (occupancyPerRoom > 4)
                throw new RoomOccupancyTooHighException();
        } catch (RoomOccupancyTooHighException exception) {
            System.out.println("ROOM OCCUPANCY TOO HIGH: " + occupancyPerRoom);
            occupancyPerRoom = 4;
        }
        maxNoOfGuests = noOfRooms * occupancyPerRoom;
    }

    {                                           // (5) Instance initializer block
        if (bankrupt)
            throw new BankruptcyException();    // (6) Throws unchecked exception
    } // ...
}

public class ExceptionsInInstBlocks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Hotel();
    }
}
```
```
Output from the program:

ROOM OCCUPANCY TOO HIGH: 5
Exception in thread "main" BankruptcyException
        at Hotel.<init>(ExceptionsInInstBlocks.java:27)
        at ExceptionsInInstBlocks.main(ExceptionsInInstBlocks.java:33)
```
