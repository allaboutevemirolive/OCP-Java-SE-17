## 10.7 Static Initializer Blocks

Java allows static initializer blocks to be defined in a class.

Although such blocks can include arbitrary code, they are primarily used for initializing static fields.

The code in a static initializer block is executed only once, when the class is loaded and initialized.

Local variables in static and instance initializer blocks can be declared with the reserved type name `var`—that is, local variable type inference using `var` is permitted for local variable declarations in initializer blocks.

Code in the rest of this chapter shows many examples of such declarations.

The syntax of a static initializer block comprises the keyword `static` followed by a local block that can contain arbitrary code, as shown at (3) in the declaration of the following class:

```java
class MatrixData {

    static final int ROWS = 12, COLUMNS = 10; // (1)
    static long[][] matrix = new long[ROWS][COLUMNS]; // (2)
    // ...
    static { // (3) Static initializer
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++)
                matrix[i][j] = 2 * i + j;
    }
    // ...
}
```
When the class `MatrixData` is first loaded, the `static final` fields at (1) are initialized.

Then the array of arrays `matrix` of specified size is created at (2), followed by the execution of the static block at (3).

Note that the static initializer block is not contained in any method.

A class can have more than one static initializer block.

Initializer blocks are `not` members of a class, and they `cannot` have a return statement because they cannot be called directly.

When a class is initialized, the `initializer expressions` in static field declarations and `static initializer blocks` are executed in the order in which they are specified in the class.

In the class `MatrixData`, the `initializer expressions` at (1) and (2) are executed before the `static initializer block` at (3).

Similar restrictions apply to `static initializer blocks` as for static initializer expressions: 
  The keywords `this` and `super` cannot occur in a static initializer block, as such a block defines a static context.


## Declaration Order of Static Initializers

In the class `ScheduleV1` below, the `static` field declaration at (1) has a `forward reference` to the `static` field `numOfWeeks` which has not been declared yet.

The simple name of the `static` field `numOfWeeks` cannot be used in the initializer expression at (1) before its declaration.

```java
public class ScheduleV1 {
//static int numOfDays  = 7 * numOfWeeks; // (1) Compile-time error! Simple name.
  static int numOfWeeks = 52;             // (2)
}
```
The code will compile if we change the order of the declarations, and the static fields numOfWeeks and numOfDays will be initialized correctly with the values 52 and 364, respectively.

```java
public class ScheduleV2 {
    static int numOfWeeks = 52; // (2) 52
    static int numOfDays = 7 * numOfWeeks; // (1) 364
}
```
The code will also compile if the class name is used to access the field, but the static field `numOfDays` will not be initialized correctly.

```java
public class ScheduleV3 {
    static int numOfDays = 7 * ScheduleV3.numOfWeeks; // (1) 0
    static int numOfWeeks = 52; // (2) 52
}
```
The code above is actually executed as follows, with the default value 0 of the static field numOfWeeks being used in the initializer expression at (1):

```java
public class ScheduleV3 {
    static int numOfDays; // Default value: 0
    static int numOfWeeks; // Default value: 0
    static {
        numOfDays = 7 * numOfWeeks; // (1) 0
        numOfWeeks = 52; // (2) 52
    }
}
```
However, the static field `numOfDays` will be initialized correctly if the static field `numOfWeeks` is declared `final`.

```java
public class ScheduleV4 {
    static int numOfDays = 7 * ScheduleV4.numOfWeeks; // (1) 364
    static final int numOfWeeks = 52; // (2) final: 52
}
```
The initializer expression `52` for the `static` field `numOfWeeks` at (2) is a `constant expression` of type `int`, which is an `int` literal.

The compiler is able to compute the value of a `constant expression`.

A `final` variable of either a primitive type or type String that is initialized with a constant expression is called a `constant variable`—that is, once initialized, the value of a `final` variable cannot be changed (§5.5, p.230).

At (2), the `final` static field `numOfWeeks` is a `constant variable`.

During class initialization, such `final static` fields are `always initialized first`, before any other initializers are executed.

Such a constant field never gets initialized with the default value of its type at runtime.

Rearrangement of code done by the compiler in this case is equivalent to the following code:

```java
public class ScheduleV4 {
    static final int numOfWeeks = 52; // Constant variable: 52
    static int numOfDays; // Default value: 0
    static {
        numOfDays = 7 * numOfWeeks; // (1) 364
    }
}
```

Static fields should be accessed statically—that is, using the class name—which is the best policy, but care should be exercised in the order of their declaration and initialization.

When making forward references using simple names, code in a `static initializer ` is subject to the `declaration-before-reading` rule.

Note that this rule applies only when the use of the field is by its `simple name`.

Using the class name to access a static field is never a problem.

Example 10.3 illustrates forward references and the order of execution for `static initializer expressions` in field declarations and code in `static initializer blocks`.

An illegal forward reference occurs at (4), where an attempt is made to read the value of the field `sf1` before its declaration.

At (11) the read operation is after the declaration, and therefore, allowed.

`Forward reference` made on the `left-hand side` of the assignment is always allowed, as shown at (2), (5), and (7).

The initializers are executed in their declaration order.

A `static` field has the value it was last assigned in an initializer.

If there is no explicit assignment, the `static` field has the default value of its type.

Referring to a static field using the class name is always allowed.

Declaring local variables using the `reserved` word `var` in `static initializer blocks` can be found at (5) and (12) in Example 10.3.

Example 10.3 S`tatic Initializers` and `Forward References`

```java
package refs1;

public class ForwardRefs {

    static { // (1) Static initializer block
        System.out.printf("Enter static block 1: sf1=%s, sf2=%s%n",
            ForwardRefs.sf1, ForwardRefs.sf2); // Enter static block 1: sf1=0, sf2=0

        sf1 = 10; // (2) OK. Assignment to sf1 allowed
        //  sf1 = if1;           // (3) Not OK. Non-static field access in static context
        //  int a = 2 * sf1;     // (4) Not OK. Read operation before declaration
        var b = sf1 = 20; // (5) OK. Assignment to sf1 allowed
        int c = ForwardRefs.sf1; // (6) OK. Not accessed by simple name

        System.out.printf("Exit static block 1:  sf1=%s, sf2=%s%n",
            ForwardRefs.sf1, ForwardRefs.sf2); // Exit static block 1:  sf1=20, sf2=0
    }

    // Field declarations:
    static int sf1 = sf2 = 30; // (7) Static field. Assignment to sf2 allowed

    static int sf2; // (8) Static field
    int if1 = 5; // (9) Non-static field

    static { // (10) Static initializer block
        System.out.printf("Enter static block 2: sf1=%s, sf2=%s%n",
            ForwardRefs.sf1, ForwardRefs.sf2); // Enter static block 2: sf1=30, sf2=30

        int d = 2 * sf1; // (11) OK. Read operation after declaration
        var e = sf1 = 50; // (12) OK. Assignment to sf1 allowed

        System.out.printf("Exit static block 2:  sf1=%s, sf2=%s%n",
            ForwardRefs.sf1, ForwardRefs.sf2); // Exit static block 2:  sf1=50, sf2=30
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {}
}
```
```
Output from the program:

Enter static block 1: sf1=0, sf2=0
Exit static block 1:  sf1=20, sf2=0
Enter static block 2: sf1=30, sf2=30
Exit static block 2:  sf1=50, sf2=30
```

Example 10.4 gives an idea of the code rearrangement that the compiler does to facilitate the initialization for the class in Example 10.3.

Field declarations from Example 10.3 are arranged first at (1) and (2) in Example 10.4, followed by a `single` `static initializer block` at (3).

The `static initializer block` in Example 10.4 

  contains the code for the first `static initializer block`, 

  followed by the `initializer expression` from the first `static field` declaration statement, 

  and lastly the code from the second `static initializer block` in the order these initializers are declared in Example 10.3.

During class initialization, first the declarations of the `static` fields `sf1` and `sf2` at (1) and (2), respectively, result in them being created and initialized to their default value 0.

Not surprisingly, execution of the code in the `static initializer block` at (3) gives the same result as in Example 10.3.

Example 10.4 `Static Initializers` and `Order of Execution`

```java
package refs2;

public class ForwardRefsSimulated {

    // Declaration of static fields:
    static int sf1; // (1) Initialized to default value: 0
    static int sf2; // (2) Initialized to default value: 0

    static { // (3) Static initializer block
        // Code from static block 1:

        System.out.printf("Enter static block 1: sf1=%s, sf2=%s%n",
            sf1, sf2); // Enter static block 1: sf1=0, sf2=0

        sf1 = 10; // (4) sf1 gets the value 10
        var b = sf1 = 20; // (5) b and sf1 get the value 20
        int c = sf1; // (6) c gets the value 20

        System.out.printf("Exit static block 1:  sf1=%s, sf2=%s%n",
            sf1, sf2); // Exit static block 1:  sf1=20, sf2=0

        // Initializer expressions for field declaration:
        sf1 = sf2 = 30; // (7) sf1 and sf2 get the value 30

        // Code from static block 2:
        System.out.printf("Enter static block 2: sf1=%s, sf2=%s%n",
            sf1, sf2); // Enter static block 2: sf1=30, sf2=30

        int d = 2 * sf1; // (8) d gets the value 60
        var e = sf1 = 50; // (9) e and sf1 get the value 50

        System.out.printf("Exit static block 2:  sf1=%s, sf2=%s%n",
            sf1, sf2); // Exit static block 2:  sf1=50, sf2=30
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {}
}
```
```
Output from the program:

Enter static block 1: sf1=0, sf2=0
Exit static block 1:  sf1=20, sf2=0
Enter static block 2: sf1=30, sf2=30
Exit static block 2:  sf1=50, sf2=30
```

## Exception Handling in Static Initializer Blocks

`Exception handling` in `static initializer blocks` is no different from that in `static initializer expressions`: Uncaught checked exceptions cannot be thrown.

Code in initializers cannot throw checked exceptions.

A `static initializer block` cannot be called directly.

Therefore, any checked exceptions must be caught and handled in the body of the `static initializer block`; otherwise, the compiler will issue an `error`.

Example 10.5 shows a `static initializer block` at (3) that catches and handles a checked exception in the `try-catch` block at (4).

Example 10.5 `Static Initializer Blocks` and `Exceptions`

// File: ExceptionInStaticInitBlocks.java

```java
package version1;

class TooManyCellsException extends Exception { // (1) Checked Exception
    TooManyCellsException(String number) {
        super(number);
    }
}
```
```java
class Prison {
    // Static Members
    private static int noOfCells = 365;
    private static int[] cells; // (2) No initializer expression

    static { // (3) Static block
        try { // (4) Handles checked exception
            if (noOfCells > 300)
                throw new TooManyCellsException(String.valueOf(noOfCells));
        } catch (TooManyCellsException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception handled: " + e);
            noOfCells = 300;
            System.out.println("No. of cells adjusted to " + noOfCells);
        }
        cells = new int[noOfCells];
    }
}
```
```java
public class ExceptionInStaticInitBlocks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new Prison();
    }
}
```
```
Output from the program:

Exception handled: version1.TooManyCellsException: 365
No. of cells adjusted to 300
```

`Static initializer blocks` do not exactly aid code readability, and should be used sparingly, if at all.

The code in the `static initializer block` at (3) in Example 10.5 

  - can easily be refactored to instantiate the `static` array field cells at (2) 
  
  - using the `private static` method at (3) that handles the checked exception `TooManyCellsException`:

```java
class Prison {
    // Static Members
    private static int noOfCells = 365;
    private static int[] cells = initPrison(); // (2) Initializer expression

    //
    private static int[] initPrison() { // (3) Private static method
        try { // (4) Handles checked exception
            if (noOfCells > 300)
                throw new TooManyCellsException(String.valueOf(noOfCells));
        } catch (TooManyCellsException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception handled: " + e);
            noOfCells = 300;
            System.out.println("No. of cells adjusted to " + noOfCells);
        }
        return new int[noOfCells];
    }
}
```
