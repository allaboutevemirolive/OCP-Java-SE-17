10.5 Initializers
Initializers can be used to set initial values for fields in objects and classes.

There are three kinds of initializers:

- Field initializer expressions
- Static initializer blocks
- Instance initializer blocks

Subsequent sections in this chapter provide details on these initializers, concluding with a discussion of the procedure involved in constructing the state of an object when the object is created using the new operator.

For brevity, we have dispensed with the access modifier for fields in most class declarations in the rest of this chapter, as field accessibility by clients is not of primary concern here.
