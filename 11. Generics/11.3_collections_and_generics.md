## 11.3 Collections and Generics

Before the introduction of generics in Java 1.5, a collection in the Java Collections Framework could hold references to objects of any type.

For example, any object which is an instance of the `java.lang.Object` class or its subclasses could be maintained in an instance of the `java.util.ArrayList` class, which implements the `java.util.List` interface.

The given statement explains the behavior of collections in the Java Collections Framework prior to the introduction of generics in Java 1.5.

Before Java 1.5, a collection, such as an `ArrayList`, could hold references to objects of any type. This means that you could store objects of different classes and types within the same collection without any type restrictions.

In Java, the `java.lang.Object` class is a superclass of all other classes, which means that any object in Java is an instance of `Object` or one of its subclasses. So, prior to the introduction of generics, an `ArrayList` could hold references to objects of any class, as long as they extended `Object` or were of the `Object` class itself.

The `ArrayList` class is an implementation of the `List` interface in the Java Collections Framework. It provides dynamic resizable arrays, allowing you to add and remove elements efficiently. Since it can hold objects of any type, you could store instances of various classes in an `ArrayList` without specifying the specific type of objects it contains.

However, this lack of type safety could lead to issues at runtime. For example, if you stored a mixture of different types in an `ArrayList` and then tried to retrieve an object of a specific type, you would need to manually check and cast the objects, which could result in runtime errors if the casting is incorrect.

The introduction of generics in Java 1.5 addressed these issues by allowing you to specify the type of objects that a collection can hold. With generics, you can declare an `ArrayList` to hold specific types, such as `String` objects, and the compiler enforces type safety, reducing the need for manual type checks and casting.

In summary, prior to the introduction of generics, collections in Java could hold references to objects of any type, including instances of the `Object` class and its subclasses. This lack of type safety was addressed by the introduction of generics, which allows you to specify the type of objects a collection can hold and provides compile-time type checking.

Give me example the implementations of generics to solve the problem above

Certainly! Here's an example of how generics can be used to solve the problem described in the previous statement:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class GenericsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> stringList = new ArrayList<>();  // Declare an ArrayList that stores only String objects
        stringList.add("Hello");
        stringList.add("World");

        String firstElement = stringList.get(0);  // No need for casting, as the list is guaranteed to contain Strings
        System.out.println(firstElement);

        // Attempting to add a non-String object will result in a compilation error
        // stringList.add(10);  // Uncommenting this line would cause a compilation error
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `List<String>` declaration uses generics to specify that the `stringList` variable will hold only `String` objects. This ensures type safety at compile-time, preventing the addition of objects of other types to the list.

By specifying the generic type as `String`, the compiler enforces that only `String` objects can be added to the `stringList`. If you try to add an object of a different type, like the commented out line `stringList.add(10);`, it will result in a compilation error.

The benefit of using generics is that it provides compile-time type checking, eliminating the need for manual type checks and casts. It ensures that the collection is used consistently with a specific type, improving code readability, maintainability, and reducing the likelihood of type-related errors at runtime.

-->


```java
List wordList = new ArrayList();     // Using non-generic types.
wordList.add("two zero two zero");   // Can add any object.
wordList.add(2020);
//...
Object element = wordList.get(0);    // Always returns an Object.
//...
if (element instanceof String str) { // Runtime check to avoid ClassCastException.
  // Use reference str.
}
```


The client of a collection has to do most of the bookkeeping with regard to using the collection in a type-safe manner: which objects are put in the collection and how objects retrieved are used.

Using the Object class as the element type allows the implementation of the collection class to be specific, but its use to be generic.

An ArrayList is a specific implementation of the List interface, but usage of the class ArrayList is generic with regard to any object.


Using a generic collection, the compiler provides the type-safety, and the resulting code is less verbose.


```java
List<String> wordList = new ArrayList<>();        // Using a specific type.
wordList.add("two zero two zero");                // Can add strings only.
wordList.add(2020);                               // Compile-time error!
//...
String element = wordList.get(0);                 // Always returns a String.
//...
```


Runtime checks or explicit casts are not necessary now.

Generic types allow the implementation of the collection class to be generic, but its use to be specific.

The generic type `ArrayList<E>` is a generic implementation of the `List<E>` interface, but now the usage of the parameterized type `ArrayList<String>` is specific, as it constrains the generic type ArrayList<E> to strings.
