## 11.5 Using References of Wildcard Parameterized Types

A wildcard type can be used to declare parameterized references—that is, references whose type is a wildcard parameterized type.

In this section, we look at how such references are used in the following contexts:

- Assignment between such references

- Calling methods of generic types using such references

The generic class `Node<E>` used in this subsection is defined in Example 11.2, p. 568.


## Generic Reference Assignment

A reference of a supertype can refer to an object of a subtype, and this substitution principle applies to parameterized types as well.

Assignment compatibility is according to the type hierarchy of the parameterized types.

Figure 11.5 shows partial type hierarchy for selected parameterized types of the generic class `Node<E>`.

It combines the type hierarchies from Figure 11.3 and Figure 11.4.

As we would expect, `widening reference conversions` according to the type hierarchy are always type-safe.

All but the last assignment statement in the code below are legal.

The types `Node<Number>` and Node<Integer> are unrelated.

(The notation B <: A means B is a subtype of A.)

```java
Node<Object>  objNode = new Node<Object>(100, null);
Node<Number>  numNode = new Node<Number>(200, null);
Node<Integer> intNode = new Node<Integer>(300, null);
Node<? extends Number> extNumNode
                       = intNode; // Node<Integer> <: Node<? extends Number>
Node<? super Integer>  supIntNode
                       = numNode; // Node<Number> <: Node<? super Integer>
supIntNode = objNode;             // Node<Object> <: Node<? super Integer>
numNode    = intNode;             // Compile-time error! Types unrelated.
```

In the code below, we get an error at (1) because the types `Node<? extends Number>` and `Node<? super Number>` are unrelated, but that is not the case for the types `Node<? extends Object>` and `Node<? super Object>` at (2).

The family of types denoted by the type `Node<? super Object>` has the subtype `Node<Object>` only, which is also a subtype of the type `Node<? extends Object>`.

In the assignment at (3), the type `Node<? extends Object>` is not a subtype of the type `Node<? super Object>`, but the converse is true as established at (2).


```java
Node<? super Number>   supNumNode;
Node<? extends Object> extObjNode;
Node<? super Object>   supObjNode;
extNumNode = supNumNode;  // (1) Compile-time error! Types unrelated.
extObjNode = supObjNode;  // (2) Node<? super Object> <: Node<? extends Object>
supObjNode = extObjNode;  // (3) Compile-time error!
```

Narrowing reference conversion requires an explicit cast, except for the cases noted below (see also Figure 11.5).

The raw type Node and the unbounded wildcard parameterized type `Node<?>` are essentially equivalent in this regard.

Conversion between the two is type-safe:

```java
Node    rawNode;
Node<?> anyNode;
rawNode = anyNode;  // Node <-- Node<?> is type-safe.
anyNode = rawNode;  // Node<?> <-- Node is type-safe.
```

The unbounded wildcard parameterized type `Node<?>` and the upper bounded wildcard parameterized type `Node<? extends Object>` are also essentially equivalent (see (4)), except when assigned a value of the raw type Node (see (5)).

```java
// (4):
anyNode = extObjNode;  // Node<?> <-- Node<? extends Object> is type-safe.
extObjNode = anyNode;  // Node<? extends Object> <-- Node<?> is type-safe.

// (5):
anyNode    = rawNode;  // Node<?> <-- Node is type-safe.
extObjNode = rawNode;  // Node<? extends Object> <-- Node: Unchecked Conversion
```


Assigning a value of the raw type Node to a reference of the type `Node<? extends Object>` results in an unchecked conversion warning—which conforms to the general rule when mixing legacy and generic code: 
- Assigning the value of a raw type to a 
- reference of a bounded wildcard parameterized type or 
- a concrete parameterized type 
- results in an unchecked conversion warning, 
as illustrated by the examples below.


<!-- Comment: 

Explain to me about Java terms, about "Unchecked Conversion"

___

In Java, "Unchecked Conversion" refers to a situation where a type cast operation is performed without explicit type checking by the compiler. It typically occurs when working with generic types and can lead to potential runtime errors if not handled correctly.

Java introduced generics in version 1.5 to provide stronger type checking and enable the creation of reusable data structures and algorithms. Generics allow you to define classes, interfaces, and methods that can operate on different types while ensuring type safety at compile time.

However, due to type erasure, which is a feature of Java generics, the type information of generic types is erased at runtime. This means that the actual type arguments used with generics are not available during runtime, and the JVM only sees the raw type. To maintain backward compatibility with pre-generic code, the Java compiler allows unchecked type casts between generic types and raw types, but it issues a warning about potential unchecked conversions.

An unchecked conversion warning occurs when you perform a type cast from a generic type to a raw type or vice versa, bypassing the compiler's type checking. For example, consider the following code snippet:

```
List<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
List rawList = strings; // Unchecked conversion warning
```

In the above code, the compiler warns about the unchecked conversion because it's assigning a generic list (`List<String>`) to a raw list (`List`). This can be dangerous because the compiler cannot guarantee type safety at compile time, and it might result in ClassCastException at runtime if incompatible types are added to the list.

To address the warning, you can use parameterized types consistently or add appropriate type information. For instance:

```
List<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
List<?> wildcardList = strings; // No unchecked conversion warning

List rawList = new ArrayList();
List<String> typedList = rawList; // Unchecked conversion warning
List<String> typedList2 = (List<String>) rawList; // Unchecked cast warning
```

In the first example, using a wildcard (`List<?>`) eliminates the unchecked conversion warning because it represents an unknown type. In the second example, assigning a raw list to a generic list generates an unchecked conversion warning. To suppress the warning, you can use a type cast, but this introduces an unchecked cast warning instead, reminding you that the cast may fail at runtime if the types are incompatible.

It's important to handle unchecked conversions carefully and ensure type safety. Suppressing warnings should be done sparingly and with a thorough understanding of the potential risks involved. You can also use `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation to suppress unchecked conversion warnings for a specific block of code, but it should be used judiciously and with caution.

-->


```java
extNumNode = rawNode; // Node<? extends Number> <-- Node: Unchecked Conversion
intNode    = rawNode; // Node<Integer> <-- Node: Unchecked Conversion
```

Suppressing different kinds of unchecked warnings with the `@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")` annotation is discussed in §11.13, p. 623, and §25.5, p. 1582.


## Using Parameterized References to Call Set and Get Methods

Generic classes are suitable for implementing ADTs called collections (also called containers) where the element type is usually specified by a type parameter.

The Java Collections Framework is a prime example of such collections.

A collection usually provides two basic operations: 
- a `set` operation (also called a write or put operation) to add an element to the collection, and 
- a `get` operation (also called a read operation) to retrieve an element from the collection.

The `set` operation takes a parameter of the type T, where T is a type parameter of the generic class.

The `get` operation returns a value of the type parameter T.

The class `Node<E>` provides these two basic operations to manipulate the data in a node:

```java
class Node<E> {
  private E data;
  // ...
  public void setData(E obj) { data = obj; }        // (1) Set operation.
  public E    getData()      { return data; }       // (2) Get operation.
  // ...
}
```


So far we have called these two methods using references of concrete parameterized types:

```java
Node<Number> numNode = new Node<>(2020, null);
numNode.setData(2021);                      // (3) Can only set a Number.
Number data = numNode.getData();            // (4) Can only get a Number.
```

The actual type parameter in the above method calls is a concrete type, but what happens when we use a reference of a wildcard parameterized type that represents a family of types? 

For example, 

what if the type of the reference numNode is `Node<? extends Number>?` 

Is the method call at (3) type-safe? 

Is the assignment at (4) type-safe? 

Operations that can potentially break the type-safety are flagged as either compile-time errors or warnings.

If there are warnings but no errors, the program still compiles.

However, type-safety at runtime is not guaranteed.


The key to using generics in Java is understanding the implications of wildcard parameterized types in the language—and why the compiler will not permit certain operations involving wildcards, since these might break the type-safety of the program.

To illustrate some of the subtleties, we compile the class in Example 11.7 successively with different headers for the method `checkIt()`.

The parameter type is different in each method header, from (h1) to (h5).

The method uses three local variables object, number, and integer of type Object, Number, and Integer, respectively ((v1) to (v3)).

There are three calls to the `setData()` method of the generic class `Node<E>` to set an Object, a Number, and an Integer as the data in the node referenced by the reference s0 ((s1) to (s3)).

There are also three calls to the `getData()` method of the generic class `Node<E>`, assigning the return value to each of the local variables ((s4) to (s6)).

And finally, the last statement, (s7), tests whether the data retrieved can be put back in again.


Example 11.7 Illustrating Get and Set Operations Using Parameterized References

```java
class WildcardAccessRestrictions {

  static void checkIt(Node s0) {                    // (h1)
//static void checkIt(Node<?> s0) {                 // (h2)
//static void checkIt(Node<? extends Number> s0) {  // (h3)
//static void checkIt(Node<? super Number> s0) {    // (h4)
//static void checkIt(Node<Number> s0) {            // (h5)
    // Local variables
    Object  object  = new Object();                 // (v1)
    Number  number  = 1.5;                          // (v2)
    Integer integer = 10;                           // (v3)
    // Method calls
    s0.setData(object);                             // (s1)
    s0.setData(number);                             // (s2)
    s0.setData(integer);                            // (s3)
    object  = s0.getData();                         // (s4)
    number  = s0.getData();                         // (s5)
    integer = s0.getData();                         // (s6)
    s0.setData(s0.getData());                       // (s7)
  }
}
```

<!-- Comment: 

Explain to me the Java code above.

___

The given code demonstrates different scenarios involving get and set operations using parameterized references. Let's go through the code and understand its components:

1. Method `checkIt`:
   - The code defines a static method called `checkIt`, which takes a parameter `s0` of type `Node`. However, there are also commented out alternative versions of the method with different type parameters `(h1)`, `(h2)`, `(h3)`, `(h4)`, and `(h5)`. These alternative versions showcase different ways of using generics and wildcard types, but they are not active in the code as they are commented out.

2. Local Variables:
   - The code declares and initializes several local variables:
     - `object` of type `Object` initialized with a new `Object()` instance `(v1)`.
     - `number` of type `Number` initialized with the value `1.5` `(v2)`.
     - `integer` of type `Integer` initialized with the value `10` `(v3)`.

3. Method Calls:
   - The code performs various method calls using the parameter `s0`:
     - `s0.setData(object)` assigns the `object` to the `data` field of `s0` `(s1)`.
     - `s0.setData(number)` assigns the `number` to the `data` field of `s0` `(s2)`.
     - `s0.setData(integer)` assigns the `integer` to the `data` field of `s0` `(s3)`.
     - `object = s0.getData()` retrieves the value stored in the `data` field of `s0` and assigns it to `object` `(s4)`.
     - `number = s0.getData()` retrieves the value stored in the `data` field of `s0` and assigns it to `number` `(s5)`.
     - `integer = s0.getData()` retrieves the value stored in the `data` field of `s0` and assigns it to `integer` `(s6)`.
     - `s0.setData(s0.getData())` assigns the value retrieved from `s0.getData()` back to the `data` field of `s0` `(s7)`.

The purpose of the code is to demonstrate different scenarios involving get and set operations on the `data` field of a `Node` object, using different types and generic constructs. However, the commented-out alternative versions of the `checkIt` method show various ways of using generics and wildcard types, providing additional flexibility and type constraints when working with `Node` objects.

-->


Attempts to compile the method in Example 11.7 with different headers are shown in Table 11.2.

The rows are statements from (s1) to (s7) from Example 11.7.

The columns indicate the type of the parameter s0 in the method headers (h1) to (h5).

The reference `s0` is used to call the methods.

The entry `ok` means the compiler did not report any errors or any unchecked warnings.

The entry `!` means the compiler did not report any errors but issued an unchecked call warning.

The entry `×` means the compiler reported an error.

In other words, we cannot carry out the operations that are marked with the entry ×.


Table 11.2 Get and Set Operations Using Parameterized References


IMAGE : Please refer to `Table 11.2` in the textbook.



## Raw Type References

The type of the reference s0 is the raw type Node.

This case illustrates the non-generic paradigm of using a collection: We can put any object, but we can only get an Object.

From Table 11.2, we see that we can put any object as data in a node of the raw type Node, but the compiler issues unchecked call warnings, as we are putting an object into a raw type node whose element type is not known.

We can only get an Object, as we cannot be more specific about the data type.


## Unbounded Wildcard References: <?>

The type of the reference `s0` is `Node<?>`.

The compiler determines that the actual type parameter for each method call is the wildcard `?`—that is, any type.

Obviously, we cannot set any data in a node whose element type cannot be determined.

It might not be type-safe.

And we cannot guarantee the type of its data either because the data type can be of any type, but we can safely read it as an `Object`.

Note that we can always write a null, as the null value can be assigned to any reference.

Typical use of unbounded wildcard reference is in writing methods that treat the objects in a container as of type Object and make use of Object methods for their operation.


<!-- Comment: 

What is "unbounded wildcard reference" in Java

___

In Java, an unbounded wildcard reference is denoted by the `?` symbol and represents an unknown type. It is used as a type argument in generic classes, methods, or wildcards to indicate that the actual type parameter can be any type. 

The unbounded wildcard reference allows for flexibility when working with unknown types, as it provides a way to write generic code that can accept any type of argument. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the specific type of the data is not important for the operations being performed.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of an unbounded wildcard reference:

```java
List<?> myList = new ArrayList<>();
myList.add("Hello");  // Valid, can add any type of object
myList.add(10);       // Valid, can add any type of object

Object element = myList.get(0);  // Retrieve the element, type is unknown
System.out.println(element);     // Output: "Hello"

// Iterate over the list
for (Object obj : myList) {
    System.out.println(obj);
}
```

In this example, we create a `List` using an unbounded wildcard reference `List<?>`. This allows the list to hold objects of any type. We can add strings, integers, or any other type of object to the list. When retrieving elements, the type is unknown, so we store them in an `Object` variable. The unbounded wildcard reference allows us to work with unknown types in a generic manner.

-->


The method below can print the data in any sequence of nodes, given the start node.

The specific type of the data in the node is immaterial.

Note also that the method is not dependent on any type parameter.

```java
void printNodeDataSequence(Node<?> s0) {       // Unbounded parameterized type
  Node<?> next = s0.getNext();                 // Returns node as Node<Object>
  while (next != null) {
    Object obj = next.getData();               // Object reference.
    System.out.println(obj.toString());        // Call Object method
    next = next.getNext();
  }
}
```


## Upper Bounded Wildcard References: <? extends Type>

The type of the reference `s0` is `Node<? extends Number>`, where `Type` is `Number`.

This means that the reference s0 refers to a node containing an object whose type is either `Number` or a subtype of `Number`, but the specific (sub)type of the object cannot always be determined at compile time.

Putting any object, except a null, into such a node might not be type-safe.

The code below shows what would happen if any object was allowed to be set as data in a `Long` node via its alias `s0`.

If (1), (2), or (3) were allowed, we would get a `ClassCastException` at (4) because the data could not be assigned to a `Long` reference, as the type-safety of the node `longNode` will have been compromised, either with a supertype object or an object of an unrelated type.

```java
Long longInt = 20L;
Node<Long> longNode = new Node<>(longInt, null);  // Node of Long, that is
Node<? extends Number> s0 = longNode;// referenced by a Node<? extends Number> ref.
s0.setData(object);                  // If this was allowed, or             (1)
s0.setData(number);                  // if this was allowed, or             (2)
s0.setData(integer);                 // if this was allowed,                (3)
longInt = longNode.getData();        // we would get an exception here.     (4)
```

longInt = longNode.getData();        // we would get an exception here.     (4)

___


In the given code, there is a `Node` class that is parameterized with type `Long`. It represents a node that holds a reference to an object of type `Long`. Here's a breakdown of what is happening:

1. We start by declaring a `Long` variable `longInt` and assigning it the value `20L`.
2. Then, we create a `Node<Long>` object called `longNode` using the `Node` class, passing `longInt` as the data and `null` as the next node reference. This creates a node specifically designed to hold `Long` values.
3. Next, we have a variable `s0` of type `Node<? extends Number>`. This means that `s0` can reference a `Node` object of any type that is a subtype of `Number`.
4. We assign `longNode` (which is a `Node<Long>`) to `s0`. This is allowed because `Node<Long>` is a subtype of `Node<? extends Number>`. The type of `s0` is now inferred to be `Node<Long>`.
5. We then have three lines of code where we attempt to set data on `s0` using the `setData` method. However, all three of these lines would result in a compilation error if they were allowed because they would violate type-safety.
   - In line `(1)`, if we set `object` (of type `Object`) as the data, it would compromise the type-safety of `longNode`, which is specifically designed to hold `Long` values.
   - In line `(2)`, if we set `number` (of type `Number`) as the data, it would also violate the type-safety of `longNode`, as `number` could potentially be a non-`Long` subtype of `Number`.
   - In line `(3)`, if we set `integer` (of type `Integer`) as the data, it would again violate the type-safety of `longNode`, as `integer` is not a `Long` value.
6. Finally, we have a line `(4)` where we attempt to retrieve data from `longNode` using the `getData` method and assign it to `longInt`. This is allowed since `longNode` is of type `Node<Long>`, and `getData` returns a `Long`. If any of the previous lines were allowed, this line could potentially throw a `ClassCastException` because the data would not be of type `Long`, as expected.

In summary, the code demonstrates how the type-safety of the `longNode` is preserved when assigning it to a variable of a wildcard type. It also highlights the potential issues that could arise if we were allowed to set incompatible data on `s0`, which would compromise the type-safety of the underlying `longNode`.


-->



The following method call will also not compile, as the compiler cannot give any guarantees at compile time that the reference `s0` will refer to a node of `Long` at runtime:

```java
s0.setData(longInt);                 // Compile-time error!
```

The upper bound in the wildcard type `? extends Number` is `Number`.

Therefore, the data of the node with the wildcard type `? extends Number` must be a `Number` (i.e., either an object of type `Number` or an object of a subtype of `Number`).

Thus we can only safely assign the reference value returned by the get operation to a reference of type `Number` or a supertype of `Number`.


## Lower Bounded Wildcard References: <? super Type>

Using a reference of type `Node<? super Number>`, where `Type` is `Number`, we can only put a `Number` or a subtype object of `Number` into the node, as such a number would also be a subtype object of any supertype of Number.

Since we cannot guarantee which specific supertype of Number the node actually has, we cannot put any supertype object of Number in the node.

The code below shows what would happen if an unrelated supertype object was put in as data in a Node<? super Number>.

If (1) were allowed, we would get a ClassCastException at (2) because the data value (of a supertype) cannot be assigned to a Number reference (which is a subtype).

```java
Node<Number> numNode = new Node<>(2020, null);
Node<? super Number> s0 = numNode;
s0.setData(object);             // (1) If this set operation was allowed,
number = numNode.getData();     // (2) we would get an exception here.
```


<!-- Comment:

If (1) were allowed, we would get a ClassCastException at (2) because the data value (of a supertype) cannot be assigned to a Number reference (which is a subtype).

Node<? super Number> s0 = numNode;

In the given code, we have a `Node` class parameterized with the type `Number`. It represents a node that holds a reference to an object of type `Number`. Let's break down what's happening:

1. We start by creating a `Node<Number>` object called `numNode` using the `Node` class, passing `2020` as the data and `null` as the next node reference. This creates a node specifically designed to hold `Number` values.
2. Next, we have a variable `s0` of type `Node<? super Number>`. This means that `s0` can reference a `Node` object whose type is either `Number` or one of its supertypes.
3. We assign `numNode` (which is a `Node<Number>`) to `s0`. This assignment is allowed because `Node<Number>` is a supertype of `Node<? super Number>`. The type of `s0` is now inferred to be `Node<Number>`.
4. We then have a line `(1)` where we attempt to set data on `s0` using the `setData` method. However, if this line were allowed, it would violate the type-safety of `numNode`.
   - If we set `object` (of type `Object`) as the data, it would compromise the type-safety of `numNode` because `object` could be of any type, potentially not compatible with `Number` or its supertypes.
5. Finally, we have a line `(2)` where we attempt to retrieve data from `numNode` using the `getData` method and assign it to the `number` variable. This is allowed since `numNode` is of type `Node<Number>`, and `getData` returns a `Number` value. If line `(1)` were allowed, this line could potentially throw a `ClassCastException` because the data value might not be compatible with `Number` or its supertypes.

In summary, the code demonstrates how assigning a `Node<Number>` to a variable of wildcard type `Node<? super Number>` allows flexibility in the type hierarchy. However, it also highlights the potential issues that could arise if we were allowed to set incompatible data on `s0`, which would compromise the type-safety of the underlying `numNode`.

-->


Since the type of the reference `s0` is `Node<? super Number>`, the reference `s0` can refer to a node containing an object whose type is either Number or some supertype of Number.

When we get the data from such a node, we can only safely assume that it is an `Object`.

Keeping in mind that a reference of a supertype of Number can refer to objects that are unrelated to Number (e.g., an Object reference that can refer to a String), if (3) were allowed in the code below, we would get a ClassCastException at (3):

```java
Node<Object> objNode = new Node<>("Hi", null);  // String as data.
Node<? super Number> s0 = objNode;
number = s0.getData();        // (3) If allowed, we would get an exception here.
object = s0.getData();        // This is always ok.
```


## Unbounded Type References: <Type>

The type of the reference `s0` is `Node<Number>`, where `Type` is `Number`.

The actual type parameter for each method call is determined to be Number.

Thus the type of the parameter in the `setData()` method and the return value of the `getData()` method is `Number`.

Therefore, we can pass the reference value of a `Number` or a subclass object of `Number` to the `setData()` method, and can assign the reference value returned by the `getData()` method to a reference of the type `Number` or a supertype of `Number`.

In this case, we can put a Number, and get a Number.

Table 11.3 gives a summary of using parameterized references for `set` and `get` operations on a container.


Here are some general guidelines for choosing a wildcard parameterized type:

- If we only want to `get` an element of type `E` from a container, we can use the upper bounded wildcard `? extends E` for the reference.

- If we only want to `put` an element of type `E` into a container, we can use the lower bounded wildcard `? super E` for the reference.

- If we want to both `get` and `set` elements of type `E` in a container, we can use the unbounded type `E` for the reference.


The following acronym might help to remember which parameterized references should be used to invoke `get` and `set` methods of a container: 

GESS (Get-`extends`-Set-`super`), meaning for a
