## 11.4 Wildcards

In this section, we discuss how using wildcards can increase the expressive power of generic types.

But first we examine one major difference between array types and parameterized types.

The generic class Node<E> used in this subsection is defined in Example 11.2, p.568.


## The Subtype Covariance Problem with Parameterized Types

The following three declarations create three nodes of Integer, Double, and Number type, respectively.

```java
Node<Integer> intNode    = new Node<>(2020,null);         // (1)
Node<Double>  doubleNode = new Node<>(3.14,null);         // (2)
Node<Number>  numNode    = new Node<>(2021, null);        // (3)
```

In the declaration at (3), the signature of the constructor call is Node(Integer, null).

The formal type parameter `E` of the generic class Node<E> is bound to the actual type parameter Number—that is, the signature of the constructor is `Node(Number, Node<Number>)`.

Since the type Integer is a subtype of the type Number, and null can be assigned to any reference, the constructor call succeeds.


In the method calls at (4) and (5) below, the method signature in both cases is setData(Number).

The method calls again succeed, since the actual parameters are of types Double and Integer, which are subtypes of Number:

```java
numNode.setData(10.5);                              // (4)
numNode.setData(2022);                              // (5)
```

However, the following calls do not succeed:

```java
numNode.setNext(intNode);                           // (6) Compile-time error!
numNode = new Node<Number>(2030, doubleNode);       // (7) Compile-time error!
```

Explain to me why code at 6 and 7 got compile error


The method calls again succeed, since the actual parameters are of types Double and Integer, which are subtypes of Number:

```java
numNode.setData(10.5);                              // (4)
numNode.setData(2022);                              // (5)
```

However, the following calls do not succeed:

```java
numNode.setNext(intNode);                           // (6) Compile-time error!
numNode = new Node<Number>(2030, doubleNode);       // (7) Compile-time error!
```

___

The code at lines 6 and 7 results in compilation errors due to type incompatibility and violation of the generic type constraints.

At line 6, the method call `numNode.setNext(intNode)` attempts to set the next node of `numNode` with `intNode`, which is presumably an instance of a node holding `Integer` data. However, the problem arises because the `setNext` method expects a parameter of the same generic type as the current node, which is `Node<Number>`. Even though `Integer` is a subclass of `Number`, the compiler does not allow this assignment because it wants to ensure strict type safety. The compiler enforces that the generic type used for the `Node` instance remains consistent, and attempting to assign a node of a different generic type would violate this constraint.

Similarly, at line 7, the code attempts to create a new `Node<Number>` instance by providing an `Integer` (`2030`) as the first argument and `doubleNode` (presumably an instance of `Node<Double>`) as the second argument. However, this assignment is not allowed because the generic type provided for the `Node<Number>` instance (`Number`) does not match the actual type (`Integer`) passed as the first argument. Again, the compiler enforces the requirement that the generic types match to ensure type safety.

In both cases, the compiler catches these errors during the compilation phase to prevent potential type-related issues at runtime.

-->

The actual type parameter at (6) is determined to be `Number`.

The generic class `Node<E>` is thus parameterized with the class Number.

The compiler complains that the method `setNext(Node<Number>)` in the parameterized class `Node<Number>` is not applicable for the actual argument `(Node<Integer>)` at (6)—that is, the method signature `setNext(Node<Number>)` is not compatible with the method call signature `setNext(Node<Integer>)`.

The compiler also complains at (7): The constructor signature `Node(Number, Node<Number>)` is not applicable for the arguments `(int, Node<Double>)`.

The problem is with the second argument at (7).

We cannot pass an argument of type `Node<Integer>` or `Node<Double>` where a parameter of type `Node<Number>` is expected.

The following assignments will also not compile:

```java
numNode = intNode;                                   // (8) Compile-time error!
numNode = doubleNode;                                // (9) Compile-time error!
```

The reason for the compile-time errors is that `Node<Integer>` and `Node<Double>` are not subtypes of `Node<Number>`, although Integer and Double are subtypes of Number.

In the case of arrays, the array types Integer[] and Double[] are subtypes of the array type Number[].

The subtyping relationship between the individual types carries over to corresponding array types.

This type relationship is called subtype covariance (see Figure 11.2).

This relationship holds for arrays because the element type is available at runtime, and can be checked.

If the subtype covariance were allowed for parameterized type, it could lead to problems at runtime, as the element type would not be known and cannot be checked, since it has been erased by the compiler.

```java
numNode = intNode;                   // If this assignment was allowed,
numNode.setData(25.5);               // the data could be corrupted,
Integer iRef = intNode.getData();    // resulting in a ClassCastException!
```

Therefore, the subtype covariance relationship does not hold for parameterized types that are instantiations of the same generic type with different actual type parameters, regardless of any subtyping relationship between the actual type parameters.

The actual type parameters are concrete types (e.g., Integer, Number), and therefore, the parameterized types are called concrete parameterized types.

Such parameterized types are totally unrelated.

As an example from the Java Collections Framework, the parameterized type `Map<Integer, String>` is not a subtype of the parameterized type `Map<Number, String>`.

## Wildcard Types

Wildcard types are type parameters defined using the wildcard symbol ?.

The wildcard ? by itself represents all types.

The parameterized type `List<?>` represents a list of all types, whereas the concrete parameterized type `List<Integer>` only represents a list of Integer.

In other words, a wildcard type can represent many types.

Therefore, a parameterized type that has wildcard types as actual type parameters can represent a family of types, in contrast to a concrete parameterized type that only represents itself.

The wildcard types provided in Java represent four subtype relationships that are summarized in Table 11.1.


Wildcard types provide the solution for increased expressive power to overcome the limitations discussed earlier when using generics in Java, but introduce limitations of their own as to what operations can be carried out on an object using references of wildcard types.

We will use the class Node<E> in Example 11.2, p.568, as a running example to discuss the use of wildcard types.

<!-- Comment: 

Give me example for each subtyping relationship for generics types above

___

Here are examples for each subtyping relationship for generic types:

1. Subtype covariance: `? extends Type`
   - Example: `List<? extends Number>`
   - Explanation: `List<? extends Number>` represents a list that can hold any subtype of `Number`, including `Integer`, `Double`, and so on. It allows reading elements from the list, as any element will be of a subtype of `Number`, but it prevents adding elements to the list because the exact subtype is unknown.

2. Subtype contravariance: `? super Type`
   - Example: `Consumer<? super Integer>`
   - Explanation: `Consumer<? super Integer>` represents a consumer that can accept any supertype of `Integer`, including `Number` or `Object`. It allows consuming instances of supertypes of `Integer`, but it does not guarantee the ability to read the exact type of the element.

3. Subtype bivariance: `?`
   - Example: `List<?>`
   - Explanation: `List<?>` represents a list that can hold elements of any type. It allows reading elements from the list, but you cannot add any specific type of element to it. It provides maximum flexibility, but you lose the ability to know the exact type of elements in the list.

4. Subtype invariance: `Type`
   - Example: `List<Integer>`
   - Explanation: `List<Integer>` represents a list that can only hold elements of type `Integer`. It is specific and fixed to a particular type, allowing you to read and write elements of that exact type. It provides the strongest type safety and guarantees the exact type of elements stored in the list.

These examples demonstrate the different subtyping relationships and the level of flexibility and type safety provided by each approach when working with generic types in Java.

What does it mean by super in "supertype of `Integer`"

___

In the context of generics, the keyword `super` is used to establish a lower bound for a wildcard or type parameter. When we say "supertype of `Integer`," it means any type that is either `Integer` itself or a type higher in the inheritance hierarchy than `Integer`.

To clarify, let's consider the following class hierarchy:

```java
class Number {}
class Integer extends Number {}
class Double extends Number {}
```

In this hierarchy, `Number` is the immediate supertype of `Integer`, and `Integer` is a subtype of `Number`. The `super` keyword is used to define a lower bound, indicating that any type that is a supertype of `Integer` (including `Number` or `Object`) is allowed.

When we use `? super Integer`, it means any type that is `Integer` itself or any supertype of `Integer` can be used. For example:

```java
List<? super Integer> myList = new ArrayList<>();
myList.add(new Integer(10));  // Valid, as Integer is a subtype of Integer
myList.add(new Number());     // Valid, as Number is a supertype of Integer
myList.add(new Object());     // Valid, as Object is a supertype of Integer
```

In the example above, the `myList` variable is declared as `List<? super Integer>`, which means it can hold any list of types that are either `Integer` or its supertypes. Therefore, we can add instances of `Integer`, `Number`, or `Object` to the list, as they all satisfy the lower bound of `? super Integer`.

Using `super` with generics allows for greater flexibility in accepting different supertypes, making it useful in scenarios where you need to work with a variety of related types in a generic manner.

<!-- Comment: 

What does it mean by subtype in "subtype of `Number`"

___

In the context of generics, the term "subtype" refers to a type that is derived from or extends another type. When we say "subtype of `Number`," it means any type that is either `Number` itself or a type that extends or inherits from `Number`.

In Java's class hierarchy, the `Number` class is a superclass for numeric wrapper classes such as `Integer`, `Double`, `Float`, and so on. These numeric wrapper classes are considered subtypes of `Number` because they inherit from it.

For example:

```java
class Number {}
class Integer extends Number {}
class Double extends Number {}
```

In this case, `Integer` and `Double` are subtypes of `Number` because they extend the `Number` class. They inherit the properties and behaviors of the `Number` class, and they can be used in places where a `Number` or any supertype of `Number` is expected.

When we refer to a "subtype of `Number`," it means any class that extends `Number`, such as `Integer` or `Double`. It includes both direct subclasses and any subsequent subclasses down the inheritance hierarchy.

In the context of generics, working with subtypes allows for greater flexibility and code reuse. By using a generic type with an upper bound of `Number` (e.g., `List<? extends Number>`), we can create a list that can hold any subtype of `Number`, such as `Integer` or `Double`. This allows us to write generic code that can handle a range of numeric types without being tightly coupled to a specific subtype.

-->




The wildcard type `? extends Number` denotes all subtypes of Number, and the parameterized type `Node<? extends Number>` denotes the family of invocations of `Node<E>` for types that are subtypes of Number.

Figure 11.3 shows a partial type hierarchy for the parameterized type `Node<? extends Number>`.

Note that the parameterized type `Node<? extends Integer>` is a subtype of the parameterized type `Node<? extends Number>`, since the wildcard type `? extends Integer` represents all subtypes of Integer, and these are also subtypes of Number.

```java
Node<? extends Integer> intSubNode = new Node<Integer>(100, null);
Node<? extends Number> numSupNode = intSubNode;
```


## Subtype Contravariance: ? super Type

The wildcard type `? super Type` represents all supertypes of Type (including Type itself).

The wildcard type `? super Type` is called a lower bounded wildcard with Type representing its lower bound.


Images : Please refer to the images in the book


Figure 11.4 Partial Type Hierarchy for Node<? super Integer>

The wildcard type `? super Integer` denotes all supertypes of Integer, and the parameterized type `Node<? super Integer>` denotes a family of invocations of `Node<E>` for types that are supertypes of `Integer`.

Figure 11.4 shows a partial type hierarchy for the parameterized type Node<? super Integer>.

Note that the parameterized type `Node<? super Number>` is a subtype of the parameterized type `Node<? super Integer>`, since the wildcard type `? super Number` represents all supertypes of `Number`, and these are also supertypes of `Integer`.

```java
Node<? super Number> numSupNode = new Node<Number>(100, null);
Node<? super Integer> numIntSupNode = numSupNode;
```


## Subtype Bivariance: ?

As mentioned earlier, the wildcard type ? represents all types.

The wildcard type ? is called the unbounded wildcard, since it has no bounds as do the other two wildcard types.

By definition, it represents both the upper and the lower bounded wildcards for any bound.


The parameterized type `Node<?>` denotes the family of invocations of `Node<E>` for any type—that is, denotes a Node of any kind, and is therefore the supertype of all invocations of Node<E> (see also Figure 11.5, p.583, and §11.5, p. 584).

Figure 11.5 Partial Type Hierarchy for Selected Parameterized Types of Node<E>


## Subtype Invariance: Type

When a concrete type `Type` is used as an actual type parameter in a parameterized type, it represents `Type` itself.

Since `Type` can be any concrete type, it is called an `unbounded type parameter`.

The concrete parameterized type `Node<Integer>` represents the invocation of `Node<E>` for the concrete actual type parameter `Integer`.

As we have seen earlier, there is no subtype covariance relationship between concrete parameterized types, but there is such a relationship between bounded parameterized types and concrete parameterized types (see also Figure 11.3 and Figure 11.4).


Let us recapitulate the basic terminology before proceeding further.

A generic type can specify one or more formal type parameters.

A parameterized type is an invocation of a generic type, supplying the required actual type parameters.

An actual type parameter can be a wildcard type (possibly bounded) or a concrete type.

A concrete type is either a non-generic type or a parameterized type that has concrete types as parameters.

Certainly! Let's explain the terminology in a more understandable way:

1. Generic Type:
   - Definition: A generic type is a type that can work with different types of objects. It can be designed to be reusable and adaptable to various data types.
   - Explanation: Instead of creating separate classes or methods for each specific type, a generic type allows you to write code that can be used with multiple types. It acts as a template that can be customized to work with different data types.

2. Parameterized Type:
   - Definition: A parameterized type is a specific usage or instantiation of a generic type by providing the actual types for the type parameters.
   - Explanation: When you use a generic type in your code and provide the actual types for the type parameters, it becomes a parameterized type. It means you're specifying the specific data types that the generic type will work with.

3. Actual Type Parameter:
   - Definition: An actual type parameter is the specific type that is used to replace the type parameter(s) of a generic type when creating a parameterized type.
   - Explanation: When you use a generic type and provide the actual types for its type parameters, those specific types are the actual type parameters. They replace the generic placeholders with concrete types, allowing the generic type to operate on those specific types.

4. Concrete Type:
   - Definition: A concrete type is a specific, definite type that is not a generic type. It can be either a non-generic type or a parameterized type with specific types provided as its parameters.
   - Explanation: A concrete type refers to a specific, actual type that is not generic. It can be a regular non-generic type like `String`, `Integer`, or any other class or interface. It can also be a parameterized type where the type arguments are specific, concrete types (e.g., `List<String>` or `Map<Integer, String>`).

In summary, a generic type is a type that can work with different types of objects. When you provide the actual types for the type parameters of a generic type, it becomes a parameterized type. The actual types used as replacements for the type parameters are called actual type parameters. A concrete type refers to a specific, non-generic type or a parameterized type with specific types provided as its parameters.

## Some Restrictions on Wildcard Types

Wildcards cannot be used in instance creation expressions:

```java
Node<?> anyNode = new Node<?>(2020, null);                 // Compile-time error!
Node<? extends Integer> extIntNodeA
               = new Node<? extends Integer>(0, null);     // Compile-time error!
Node<? extends Integer> extIntNodeB = new Node<Integer>(0, null);  // OK
```

The actual type parameter in the constructor call must be a concrete type.

Creating instances of wildcard parameterized types is analogous to instantiating interface types; neither can be used in object creation expressions.


Wildcards cannot be used in the header of reference type declarations.

Supertypes in the `extends` and `implements` clauses cannot have wildcards.


```java
class QuestionableNode<?>  { /* ... */ }                             // Not OK.
class SubNode extends Node<?> { /* ... */ }                          // Not OK.
interface INode extends Comparable<? extends Node<?>> { /* ... */ }  // Not OK.
class XNode implements Comparable<?>  { /* ... */ }                  // Not OK.
```


However, nested wildcards are not a problem in a reference type declaration header or in an object creation expression:

```java
class OddNode extends Node<Node<?>> implements Comparable<Node<?>> { /* ... */ }
...
Node<?> nodeOfAnyNode = new Node<Node<?>>(new Node<Integer>(2020, null), null);
```

<!-- Comment: 

How to read this code in Java?


```java
class OddNode extends Node<Node<?>> implements Comparable<Node<?>> { /* ... */ }
...
Node<?> nodeOfAnyNode = new Node<Node<?>>(new Node<Integer>(2020, null), null);
```

___


To understand the code, let's break it down step by step:

1. Class Definition:
```java
class OddNode extends Node<Node<?>> implements Comparable<Node<?>> {
    // ...
}
```
This code defines a class called `OddNode`. It extends the `Node<Node<?>>` class, which means that `OddNode` is a subclass of `Node<Node<?>>`. It also implements the `Comparable<Node<?>>` interface. This implies that `OddNode` can be compared with other objects of type `Node<?>` (any `Node` with an unknown type).

2. Object Creation:
```java
Node<?> nodeOfAnyNode = new Node<Node<?>>(new Node<Integer>(2020, null), null);
```
This code creates an object named `nodeOfAnyNode` of type `Node<?>`. It uses the `Node<Node<?>>` class as the specific type argument. 

The constructor `new Node<Node<?>>(new Node<Integer>(2020, null), null)` is called to instantiate the `Node<Node<?>>` object. The constructor takes two arguments: the first argument is a `Node<Integer>` object initialized with the values `2020` and `null`, and the second argument is `null`. 

In this case, `Node<?>` is a wildcard type, which means it represents a node of any type (unknown at compile time). The specific type of the `Node` objects inside `nodeOfAnyNode` is not known, but it can be any type due to the wildcard `?`.

Overall, the code defines a class `OddNode` that extends `Node<Node<?>>` and implements `Comparable<Node<?>>`. It also creates an instance of `Node<?>` named `nodeOfAnyNode` with a `Node<Node<?>>` as its value, using the `Node<Node<?>>` constructor.
