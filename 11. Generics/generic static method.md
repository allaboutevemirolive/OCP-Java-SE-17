Explain to me about generic static method in Java with examples
___

In Java, a generic static method is a method defined within a class that introduces its own type parameters and is associated with the class itself rather than an instance of the class. It allows you to create generic methods that can work with different types without requiring an instance of the class.

To define a generic static method, you specify the type parameters before the method's return type, similar to generic instance methods. However, since the method is associated with the class itself, it does not have access to instance-specific fields or methods.

Here's an example to illustrate a generic static method:

```java
public class MathUtils {
    public static <T> T getMax(T[] array) {
        if (array == null || array.length == 0) {
            return null;
        }
        
        T max = array[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++) {
            if (array[i].compareTo(max) > 0) {
                max = array[i];
            }
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `MathUtils` class has a generic static method `getMax()`. It introduces its own type parameter `<T>`. The method takes an array of type `T` as a parameter and returns the maximum element from the array.

The `getMax()` method uses the type parameter `T` to compare elements of the array using the `compareTo()` method. The method is not associated with a specific instance of the class and can be invoked directly on the class itself.

Here's how you can use the `MathUtils` class and its generic static method:

```java
Integer[] intArray = { 5, 8, 2, 10, 3 };
Integer maxInt = MathUtils.getMax(intArray);
System.out.println("Max Integer: " + maxInt); // Output: Max Integer: 10

String[] stringArray = { "apple", "banana", "orange" };
String maxString = MathUtils.getMax(stringArray);
System.out.println("Max String: " + maxString); // Output: Max String: orange
```

In the above code, we create arrays of different types (`Integer` and `String`) and invoke the `getMax()` method on the `MathUtils` class. The method determines the maximum element based on the type-specific comparison and returns the result.

Generic static methods are useful when you need to perform operations that are not dependent on instance-specific fields or methods. They allow you to create reusable code that can work with different types without requiring an instance of the class.
