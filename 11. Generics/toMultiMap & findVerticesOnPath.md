In the given code examples, there are two methods defined with generic type parameters in their method signatures. Let's break them down in a simple and understandable way:

1. `toMultiMap` method:
   - This method takes a `Map<K, V>` called `origMap` as a parameter.
   - The method's return type is `Map<V, List<K>>`.
   - The method is generic with type parameters `<K, V>`.
   - The method creates a new map where the keys are the values from the original map (`origMap`) and the values are lists of keys from the original map. Essentially, it transforms a regular map into a multimap structure.

2. `findVerticesOnPath` method:
   - This method takes two parameters: a `Map<N, Collection<N>>` called `graph` and an `N` called `startVertex`.
   - The method's return type is `Set<N>`.
   - The method is generic with a type parameter `N`.
   - The purpose of this method is to find and return a set of vertices that are connected in a graph (represented by the `graph` map) starting from the given `startVertex`.
   - The generic type parameter `N` is used to specify the element type of the set of vertices, the type of keys in the `graph` map, the element type of the collections that are values of the map, and the type of the `startVertex`.

In both cases, the generic type parameters are used to express the relationships between the method parameters and the return type, ensuring type safety and flexibility when working with different types of data structures.

By using generic type parameters, these methods can be used with various types of maps, such as maps with different key-value types or maps that represent different graph structures. The type parameters allow the methods to be more flexible and reusable, handling different types of data without sacrificing type safety.
