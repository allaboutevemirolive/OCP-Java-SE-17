## 11.2 Generic Types and Parameterized Types

We first introduce the basic terminology and concepts relating to generics in Java.

Note that the discussion here on generic and parameterized types also applies to enum types (§5.13, p.287) and record classes (§5.14, p.299).


## Generic Types

A generic type is a reference type that defines a list of formal type parameters or type variables that must be provided before it can be used as a type.

Example 11.2 declares a generic type which, in this case, is a generic class called `Node<E>` that allows nodes of specific types to be maintained.

It has only one formal type parameter, `E`, that represents the type of the data in a node.

```java
class Node < E > {
    ...
}
```
The formal type parameter `E` does not explicitly specify a type, but serves as a placeholder for a type to be defined in an invocation of the generic type.

The formal type parameters of a generic type are specified within angle brackets, `<>`, immediately after the class name.

A type parameter is an unqualified identifier.

If a generic class has several formal type parameters, these are specified as a comma-separated list, <T1, T2, ..., Tn>.

It is quite common to use one-letter names for formal type parameters; a convention that we will follow in this book.

For example, `E` is used for the type of `elements` in a collection, 

`K` and `V` are used for the type of the `keys` and the type of the `values` in a map, 

and `T` is used to represent an `arbitrary` type.


As a starting point for declaring a generic class, we can begin with a class where the `Object` type is utilized to generalize the use of the class.

In Example 11.2, the declaration of the generic class `Node<E>` uses `E` in all the places where the type `Object` was used in the declaration of the class `LegacyNode` in Example 11.1.

From the declaration of the class `Node<E>`, we can see that the formal type `E` is used like a reference type in the class body: 
  - as a `field` type at (1), 
  - as a `return` type at (5), 
  - and as a `parameter` type in the methods at (4) to (8).

Use of the class name in the generic class declaration is parameterized by the type parameter ((2), (6), (7)), with one notable exception: 

  The formal type parameter is not specified after the class name in the constructor declaration at (3).

Which actual reference type the formal type parameter `E` represents is not known in the generic class `Node<E>`.

Therefore, we can only call methods that are inherited from the Object class on the field data, as these methods are inherited by all objects, regardless of their object type.

One such example is the call to the `toString()` method in the method declaration at (8).


The scope of the type parameter `E` of the generic type includes any non-static inner classes, but excludes any static member types—the parameter `E` cannot be accessed in static context.

It also excludes any nested generic declarations where the same name is redeclared as a formal type parameter.

Shadowing of type parameter names should be avoided.

Example 11.2 A Generic Class for Nodes

```java
class Node < E > {
    private E data;          // Data                           (1)
    private Node < E > next; // Reference to next node         (2)
    Node(E data, Node < E > next) {                         // (3)
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }
    public void setData(E data) {
        this.data = data;                                   // (4)
    }                                                       
    public E getData() {
        return this.data;                                   // (5)
    }                                                       
    public void setNext(Node < E > next) {
        this.next = next;                                   // (6)
    }                                                       
    public Node < E > getNext() {
        return this.next;                                   // (7)
    }                                                       
    @Override
    public String toString() {                              // (8)
        return this.data.toString() +
            (this.next == null ? "" : ", " + this.next.toString());
    }
}
```

## Some Restrictions on the Use of Type Parameters in a Generic Type

A constructor declaration in a generic class `cannot` specify the formal type parameters of the generic class in its constructor header after the class name:

```java
class Node < E > {
    ...
    Node < E > () {
        ...
    } // Compile-time error!
    ...
}
```

A formal type parameter `cannot` be used to create a new instance, as it is not known which concrete type it represents.

The following code in the declaration of the `Node<E>` class would be illegal:

```java
E ref = new E();                           // Compile-time error!
```

A formal type parameter is a non-static type.

It `cannot` be used in a static context, for much the same reason as an instance variable `cannot` be used in a static context: It is associated with objects.

The compiler will report errors at (1), (2), and (3) in the code below:

```java
class Node < E > {
    private static E e1;                    // (1) Compile-time error!
    public static E oneStaticMethod(E e2) { // (2) Compile-time error!
        E e3;                               // (3) Compile-time error!
        System.out.println(e3);
    }
    // ...
}
```

## Parameterized Types

A parameterized type (also called a type instance) is an invocation or instantiation of a generic type that is a specific usage of the generic type where the formal type parameters are replaced by actual type parameters.

Analogy with `method declarations` and `method invocations` can be helpful in understanding the relationship between generic types and parameterized types.

We pass actual parameters in a method invocation to execute a method.

In the case of a generic type invocation, we pass actual type parameters in order to instantiate a generic type.


We can declare references and create objects of parameterized types, and call methods on these objects, in much the same way as we use non-generic classes.


```java
Node<Integer> intNode = new Node<Integer>(2020, null);
```

The actual type parameter Integer, explicitly specified in the declaration statement above, binds to the formal type parameter E in Example 11.2.

The compiler treats the parameterized type `Node<Integer>` as a new type.

The parameterized type `Node<Integer>` constrains the generic type `Node<E>` to Integer objects, thus implementing homogenous nodes with Integers.

The reference `intNode` can only refer to a Node of Integer.

The node created can only be used to store an object of this concrete type.


Methods can be called on objects of parameterized types:

```java
Integer iRef = intNode.getData();            // Integer object with int value 2020
```

In the method call above, the actual type parameter is determined from the type of the reference used to make the call.

The type of the intNode reference is Node<Integer>; therefore, the actual type parameter is Integer.

The method header is Integer getData(), meaning that the method will return a value of type Integer.

The compiler checks that the return value can be assigned.

As the compiler guarantees that the return value will be an Integer and can be assigned, no explicit cast or runtime check is necessary.

<!-- Comment:

What is explicit cast and runtime check in Java?


In Java, an explicit cast is a type conversion that you perform explicitly in your code to convert a value from one type to another. It allows you to convert a variable of one data type to another compatible data type. 

For example, consider the following code:

```java
double x = 3.14;
int y = (int) x;
```

In this code, the value of the `double` variable `x` is explicitly casted to an `int` using `(int)`. The explicit cast tells the Java compiler that you are aware of the potential loss of precision when converting from `double` to `int`, and you want to perform the cast.

However, it's important to note that an explicit cast may result in a runtime exception if the types are not compatible or if the value being casted cannot be accommodated by the target type. For example:

```java
double x = 3.14;
int y = (int) "hello"; // Results in a ClassCastException at runtime
```

In this case, the explicit cast of a `String` to an `int` is not valid, and it will result in a `ClassCastException` being thrown at runtime.

Runtime type checks, on the other hand, refer to the checks performed by the Java runtime system to ensure that a certain type relationship is valid at runtime. These checks are performed dynamically during the execution of the program. If a type relationship violation is detected at runtime, an exception is thrown.

For example, consider the following code:

```java
Object obj = "Hello";
Integer i = (Integer) obj; // Results in a ClassCastException at runtime
```

In this code, an `Object` reference `obj` is holding a `String` object. At runtime, the explicit cast `(Integer)` is performed to cast `obj` to an `Integer`. However, since the actual object is a `String` and not an `Integer`, a `ClassCastException` will be thrown at runtime. This is because the Java runtime system performs a runtime type check to ensure the validity of the cast.

-->

The compiler actually inserts the necessary cast.

Here are some more examples of calling methods of parameterized types:

```java
intNode.setData(2020);                             // Ok.
intNode.setData("TwentyTwenty");                   // (1) Compile-time error!
intNode.setNext(new Node<Integer>(2019, null));    // (2020, (2019, null))
intNode.setNext(new Node<String>("Hi", null));     // (2) Compile-time error!
```

In the method calls shown above, the compiler determines that the actual type parameter is Integer.

The method signatures are setData(Integer) and setNext(Node<Integer>).

As expected, we get a compile-time error when we try to pass an argument that is not compatible with the parameter type in the method declarations; for example, at (1) and (2).

The parameterized types Node<Integer> and Node<String> are two unrelated types.

The compiler reports any inconsistent use of a parameterized type so that errors can be caught earlier at compile time and the use of explicit casts in the source code is minimized, as evident from (3) and (4), respectively.

```rust
Node<String> strNode = new Node<String>("Hi", null);
intNode = strNode;                         // (3) Compile-time error!
String str = strNode.getData();            // (4) No explicit cast necessary.
```


## The Diamond Operator (<>)

In the object creation expression of the `new` operator, the actual type parameter was explicitly specified after the class name—in contrast to the constructor declaration.

```java
Node<String> lst = new Node<String>("Hi", null); // Explicit actual type parameter
```

The actual type parameters can be omitted, but not the angle brackets (<>), if the compiler can infer the actual type parameters from the context of the object creation expression.

The angle brackets with no actual parameters (<>) are commonly referred to as the diamond operator.

```java
Node<String> lst = new Node<>("Hi", null); // Actual type parameter inferred.
```

In the object creation expression above, the compiler performs automatic type inference to infer that the actual type parameter in the expression must be String.

The compiler is able to infer the actual type parameter from the type information of the constructor call arguments.

```java
new Node<>(null, null);  // Actual type parameter: Object.
```

In the code below, the compiler uses the type information of the variable on the left-hand side to infer the actual type parameter of the object creation expression, thereby ensuring compatibility with the target type on the left-hand side of the assignment.

```java
Node<String>  strNode = new Node<>(null, null); // Actual type parameter: String.

Node<Integer> intNode = new Node<>(null, null); // Actual type parameter: Integer.

Node<Number>  numNode = new Node<>(null, null); // Actual type parameter: Number.

Node<Number>  lstNode = new Node<>(2021, null); // Actual type parameter: Number.
```

In the last declaration, the int value 2021 is boxed into an Integer object that can be assigned to a reference of its superclass Number.

In other words, the signature of the constructor call is Node<Number>(Number, Node<Number>).


Given the following scenario:

```java
// (1) Method declaration with parameterized type as formal parameter.
void find(Node<String> node) { /* ... */ }
...
// (2) Method call where actual argument uses diamond operator.
find(new Node<>(null,null));  // Actual type parameter: Object or String?
```

The compiler takes the target type (Node<String>) in the method declaration into consideration, correctly inferring the actual type parameter to be String, in order for the actual and the formal parameters in the call to be assignment compatible.

A single diamond operator must replace the entire actual type parameter list in the object creation expression.

In the first declaration below, the compiler infers that the actual type parameter list is <String, List<Integer>>.

```java
HashMap<String, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();
HashMap<String, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<String,<>>(); // Error!
```

<!-- Comment:

The code below is in Java. Explain to me what happen to the codes below

code 1 :
HashMap<String, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>(); 

code 2:
HashMap<String, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<String,<>>(); // Error! 

___


The code you provided demonstrates the usage of a `HashMap` in Java to store a mapping between keys of type `String` and values of type `List<Integer>`.

1. **Code 1:**
```java
HashMap<String, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();
```
In this code, a `HashMap` object is created using the default constructor. The type parameters `<String, List<Integer>>` specify that the keys in the map will be of type `String`, and the corresponding values will be of type `List<Integer>`. The diamond operator `<>` is used to infer the type parameters based on the declaration, eliminating the need to repeat them on the right side of the assignment. This code is correct and will create an instance of `HashMap` with the specified key-value types.

2. **Code 2:**
```java
HashMap<String, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<String,<>>();
```
In this code, there is a syntax error. The type parameter for the `HashMap` constructor is not specified correctly. It seems that there is an incomplete syntax for the type parameter of the `HashMap` constructor. The correct syntax for specifying the type parameter is `<String, List<Integer>>`. The code as written will result in a compilation error.

To fix the error, you should remove the extra `<,>` and use the correct syntax:
```java
HashMap<String, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<String, List<Integer>>();
```
This code specifies the type parameters `<String, List<Integer>>` correctly, ensuring that the `HashMap` is initialized with the appropriate key-value types.

If the actual type parameters are not specified and the diamond operator is omitted, the compiler issues an unchecked conversion warning—that is, the code will compile, but all bets are off at runtime.


<!-- Comment:

Explain to me this statement


"If the actual type parameters are not specified and the diamond operator is omitted, the compiler issues an unchecked conversion warning—that is, the code will compile, but all bets are off at runtime."

___

The statement you provided is referring to the usage of the diamond operator (`<>`) in Java when working with generic types. It explains the consequences of omitting the diamond operator and not explicitly specifying the type parameters when using generic classes.

In Java, when using generic classes, you can provide type parameters to ensure type safety and enable the compiler to perform type checks. However, to make the code more concise, Java introduced the diamond operator (`<>`) as a shorthand notation to infer the type parameters based on the context.

The statement explains the behavior when the diamond operator is omitted and the actual type parameters are not explicitly specified. In this case, the compiler will issue an unchecked conversion warning. This warning indicates that the code will compile, but there is a potential risk at runtime.

By omitting the diamond operator and not specifying the type parameters, the compiler cannot perform type checking and ensure type safety. This can lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior if incompatible types are used.

For example, consider the following code:

```java
List<String> myList = new ArrayList();  // Warning: unchecked conversion
myList.add(123);                        // Compiles, but issues a warning
String str = myList.get(0);             // Runtime ClassCastException
```

In this code, the diamond operator is omitted when creating the `ArrayList`. As a result, the compiler issues an unchecked conversion warning. The code still compiles, but at runtime, when adding an `int` to a `List<String>`, a `ClassCastException` occurs because the type safety is violated.

To avoid these risks and ensure type safety, it is recommended to use the diamond operator (`<>`) or explicitly specify the type parameters when working with generic classes.

Below, the reference type Node in the object creation expression is interpreted as a raw type.

Implications of interoperability between generic types and raw types are discussed on p.575.

<!-- Comment:

Explain to me in concise and understandable about implications of interoperability between generic types and raw types in Java.

___


Interoperability between generic types and raw types in Java refers to the ability to use generic classes alongside their non-generic counterparts, which are known as raw types. While this interoperability provides flexibility, it also has implications that can affect type safety and lead to potential issues. Here are the key implications:

1. **Type Safety:** Raw types bypass the compile-time type checks enforced by generics. This means that you can use a raw type where a generic type is expected, but you lose the benefits of compile-time type checking. This can lead to type-related errors that may only be discovered at runtime.

2. **Warnings and Unchecked Operations:** When using raw types, the Java compiler generates warnings to alert you about potential type safety issues. These warnings serve as a reminder to exercise caution and indicate that the code may contain unchecked operations. Unchecked operations refer to situations where the compiler cannot guarantee type safety due to the use of raw types.

3. **Compatibility with Legacy Code:** Raw types allow compatibility with legacy code that predates the introduction of generics in Java. This interoperability is useful when working with older libraries or codebases that have not been updated to utilize generics.

4. **Reduced Expressiveness:** Raw types lack the ability to convey specific type information, resulting in reduced expressiveness of your code. Generics enable you to specify and enforce type constraints, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

5. **Avoiding Raw Types:** It is generally recommended to use generic types whenever possible to maximize type safety and benefit from compile-time checks. Raw types should be used sparingly and primarily for interacting with legacy code. Whenever feasible, it is advisable to update legacy code to utilize generics to improve type safety and take advantage of modern language features.

To summarize, interoperability between generic types and raw types allows for flexibility and compatibility but introduces potential type safety issues. It is important to use generics whenever possible to benefit from compile-time type checking and ensure type safety. Raw types should be used judiciously and mainly when interacting with legacy code.

<!-- Comment:

Give me example  of implications of interoperability between generic types and raw types
___

Certainly! Here's an example that demonstrates the implications of interoperability between generic types and raw types in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class InteroperabilityExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> genericList = new ArrayList<>();
        genericList.add("Hello");
        genericList.add("World");

        List rawList = genericList; // Interoperability with raw type

        rawList.add(123); // Compiles, but bypasses type checking

        String str = genericList.get(2); // Runtime error: ClassCastException

        System.out.println("Elements in genericList: " + genericList);
    }
}
```

In this example, we have a generic `ArrayList` of type `String` called `genericList`. We add two string elements to it successfully. 

However, we also have a raw `List` called `rawList` that is assigned the value of `genericList`. This demonstrates interoperability between the generic type and raw type. 

Since `rawList` is a raw type, it allows us to add an `int` value (`123`) to the list without any compile-time warnings. This bypasses the type checking provided by generics.

Later, when we try to retrieve the elements from `genericList` using the `get()` method, we encounter a `ClassCastException`. This is because we added an `int` value to `rawList`, which corrupts the type safety of `genericList`. The issue was not caught at compile time, leading to a runtime error.

The example highlights the implications of interoperability between generic types and raw types. The unchecked operation (adding an `int` to `rawList`) bypasses compile-time type checking and leads to a runtime error when accessing elements from `genericList`. This demonstrates the importance of using generic types to ensure type safety and avoid such issues.

How to fix the issue above

___

To fix the issue in the example above and ensure type safety, you should avoid using raw types and utilize generic types consistently. Here's the modified code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class InteroperabilityExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> genericList = new ArrayList<>();
        genericList.add("Hello");
        genericList.add("World");

        List<String> newList = new ArrayList<>(genericList); // Create a new generic list

        newList.add(123); // Compilation error: incompatible types

        String str = newList.get(2); // Compilation error: index out of bounds

        System.out.println("Elements in newList: " + newList);
    }
}
```

In the fixed code:

1. Instead of using a raw type, we create a new generic `ArrayList` called `newList` that has the same element type (`String`) as `genericList`.

2. When adding an `int` value (`123`) to `newList`, the code results in a compilation error. This is because the element type is specified as `String`, and attempting to add an `int` violates the type constraint.

3. Similarly, when trying to retrieve an element at index `2` from `newList`, the code results in a compilation error. This is because the `newList` only contains two elements (`"Hello"` and `"World"`), and index `2` is out of bounds.

By consistently using generic types and avoiding raw types, the fixed code ensures type safety and detects type-related errors at compile time, preventing potential runtime issues.

-->


<!-- Comment:

So, both codes above still result in compilation errors even when using generic types. So what is the advantage or reasonable reason for this? I cannot understand since both codes won't compile.

___

Apologies for the confusion caused by the modified code. You are correct that both codes still result in compilation errors due to intentional mistakes introduced for demonstration purposes. 

The advantage and reasonable reason for using generic types in Java are as follows:

1. **Type Safety:** The primary advantage of using generic types is to enhance type safety. By specifying the types of elements or objects that a class or collection can contain, the compiler performs compile-time type checks and ensures that only compatible types are used. This helps to catch type-related errors at compile time and avoid potential runtime errors.

2. **Code Clarity and Readability:** Generics provide a way to express the intended type relationships in the code. By using meaningful type parameters, it becomes clear what types are expected and used in different parts of the code. This improves code readability and makes it easier for developers to understand and maintain the codebase.

3. **Compile-Time Error Detection:** The compilation errors you encountered in the modified code demonstrate the benefit of generics. When using generic types correctly, the compiler can detect type-related errors early during the compilation process, making it easier to fix issues before running the code.

4. **Enforced Type Constraints:** Generics allow you to enforce type constraints and enable compile-time checks to ensure that the code follows the specified type relationships. This helps prevent type mismatches, improves code robustness, and reduces the likelihood of errors caused by incompatible types.

In summary, although the modified code contained intentional mistakes resulting in compilation errors, the purpose was to emphasize the importance of using generic types to ensure type safety and leverage the benefits provided by the Java compiler. Proper use of generics can help catch type-related errors at compile time, enhance code clarity, and enforce type constraints, leading to more robust and maintainable code.

```java
Node<String> rawNode = new Node("Hi", null); // Unchecked conversion warning!
```


The diamond operator can be used to instantiate an anonymous class (see p.633).

```java
new Node<>("Hi", null) {/* ... */}; // Parameterized type: Node<String>
new Node("Hi", null)   {/* ... */}; // Raw type: Node
```

<!-- Comment:

What does it mean by this statement?


The diamond operator can be used to instantiate an anonymous class (see p.633).

```java
new Node<>("Hi", null) {/* ... */}; // Parameterized type: Node<String>
new Node("Hi", null)   {/* ... */}; // Raw type: Node

___


The statement you provided refers to the usage of the diamond operator (`<>`) to instantiate an anonymous class in Java. The diamond operator allows you to create an instance of a generic class without explicitly specifying the type parameters.

In the given code examples:

```java
new Node<>("Hi", null) {/* ... */}; // Parameterized type: Node<String>
new Node("Hi", null)   {/* ... */}; // Raw type: Node
```

The first line uses the diamond operator (`<>`) when creating a new instance of the `Node` class. It specifies the type parameter as `String`, indicating that the instance is of the parameterized type `Node<String>`. The anonymous class implementation inside the braces (`{/* ... */}`) can define additional behavior or override methods as needed.

The second line omits the diamond operator and creates a new instance of the `Node` class without specifying the type parameter. This results in the creation of a raw type `Node`. 

Raw types are used when :
- interacting with legacy code or 
- in situations where the generic type information is intentionally not provided. 

However, using raw types bypasses the type safety checks and benefits provided by generics.

It's important to note that using raw types is generally discouraged, as it undermines the type safety and compile-time checks provided by generics. It is recommended to use the diamond operator (`<>`) or explicitly specify the type parameters when creating instances of generic classes to ensure type safety and leverage the advantages of generics.

## Parameterized Local Variable Type Inference

Consider the four local variable declarations shown below.

The first three declarations are equivalent, as they create a Node<String> object whose data and next fields are null.

In declaration (1), since the type String is explicitly specified in the object creation expression, the actual type parameter is deduced to be String.

In declaration (2), the diamond operator is specified in the object creation expression, but the compiler is able to infer that the actual type parameter is String from the left-hand side of the declaration—that is, the compiler considers the context of the whole declaration.

In the case of the parameterized local variable declarations with var, both the actual type parameters and the parameterized type denoted by var are inferred from the object creation expression.

```java
// Parameterized local variable declarations:
Node<String> node1 = new Node<String>(null, null); // (1) Node of String
Node<String> node2 = new Node<>(null, null);       // (2) Node of String
var node3 = new Node<String>(null, null);          // (3) Node of String
var node4 = new Node<>(null, null);                // (4) Node of Object
```

In declaration (3), as String is explicitly specified in the object creation expression, the actual type parameter is inferred to be String and the parameterized type of node3 denoted by var is inferred to be Node<String>.


However, in declaration (4), the diamond operator is used in the object creation expression.

In this case, the actual type parameter is inferred to be Object and the parameterized type of node4 denoted by var is inferred to be Node<Object>.

Adequate type information should be provided in the object creation expression when declaring parameterized local variables with var in order to avoid unexpected types being inferred for the actual parameter types and the parameterized type denoted by var.


## Generic Interfaces

Generic types also include generic interfaces, which are declared analogous to generic classes.

The specification of formal type parameters in a generic interface is the same as in a generic class.

Example 11.3 declares a generic interface that defines the reference type IMonoLink<E> for objects that store a data value of type E.


Example 11.3 A Generic Interface and Its Implementation


```java
interface IMonoLink < E > {
    void setData(E data);
    E getData();
    void setNext(IMonoLink < E > next);
    IMonoLink < E > getNext();
}

class MonoNode < E > implements IMonoLink < E > {
    private E data; // Data
    private IMonoLink < E > next; // Reference to next node                    (1)

    MonoNode(E data, IMonoLink < E > next) {                                // (2)
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
    }

    @Override public void setData(E data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    @Override public E getData() {
        return this.data;
    }

    @Override public void setNext(IMonoLink < E > next) {
        this.next = next;
    }                                                                       // (3)

    @Override public IMonoLink < E > getNext() {
        return this.next;
    }                                                                       // (4)

    @Override public String toString() {
        return this.data.toString() + (this.next == null ? "" : ", " + this.next);
    }
}
```


A generic interface can be implemented by a generic (or a non-generic) class:

```java
class MonoNode<E> implements IMonoLink<E> {
    // ...
}
```

Note that the construct <E> is used in two different ways in the class header.

The first occurrence of <E> declares E to be a type parameter, and the second occurrence of <E> parameterizes the generic interface with this type parameter.

The declare-before-use rule also applies to type parameters.

The version of the MonoNode class in Example 11.3 differs from the Node class in Example 11.2 at (1), (2), (3), and (4).

These changes were necessary to make the MonoNode<E> class compliant with the IMonoLink<E> interface.


A generic interface can be parameterized in the same way as a generic class.

In the code below, the reference strNode has the parameterized type IMonoLink<String>.

It is assigned the reference value of a node of inferred type MonoNode<String>.

The assignment is legal, since the parameterized type MonoNode<String> is a subtype of the parameterized type IMonoLink<String>:

```java
IMonoLink<String> strNode2 = new MonoNode<>("Bye", null);
System.out.println(strNode2.getData());                    // Prints: Bye
```

As with non-generic interfaces, generic `interfaces` cannot be instantiated either:

```java
IMonoLink<String> strNode3 = new IMonoLink<>("Bye", null); // Compile-time error!
```

Example 11.4 shows a non-generic class implementing a generic interface.

The generic interface IMonoLink<E> is parameterized by a concrete type, namely, Lymph.

The type LymphNode is a subtype of the parameterized type IMonoLink<Lymph>, as it implements the methods of the generic interface IMonoLink<E> in accordance with the concrete type parameter Lymph.


<!-- Comment: 

Explain to me why the second code below got compile time error

```java
IMonoLink<String> strNode3 = new IMonoLink<>("Bye", null); // Compile-time error!
```

notice "new IMonoLink<>"

___

In the code provided:

```java
IMonoLink<String> strNode3 = new IMonoLink<>("Bye", null); // Compile-time error!
```

The error occurs because you are attempting to instantiate an interface, which is not allowed in Java. Interfaces cannot be directly instantiated because they are meant to define a contract for implementing classes.

The interface `IMonoLink<String>` is a generic interface parameterized with `String`. It serves as a contract for classes that implement it. However, you cannot create an instance of an interface directly using the `new` keyword.

To use the interface, you need to create a concrete class that implements it. For example, you could have a class `MonoNode` that implements `IMonoLink` as shown in the previous code example:

```java
class MonoNode<E> implements IMonoLink<E> {
    // Implementation of methods in IMonoLink
    // ...
}
```

In this case, you can create an instance of `MonoNode` and assign it to a variable of type `IMonoLink<String>`:

```java
IMonoLink<String> strNode2 = new MonoNode<>("Bye", null);
System.out.println(strNode2.getData()); // Prints: Bye
```

Here, `MonoNode` is a class that implements the `IMonoLink` interface, and you can create an instance of `MonoNode` with the appropriate type parameters and assign it to a variable of type `IMonoLink<String>`.

The Java standard library contains many examples of generic interfaces.

The two interfaces java.lang.Comparable<E> and java.util.Comparator<E> are discussed in detail in §14.4, p.761, and §14.5, p.769, respectively.

The Java Collections Framework also includes many examples of generic interfaces, such as Collection<E>, List<E>, Set<E>, and Map<K,V> (Chapter 15, p.781).


Example 11.4 A Non-Generic Class Implementing a Generic Interface

```java
// File: LymphNode.java
class Lymph {
    /*... */
}

public class LymphNode implements IMonoLink < Lymph > {
    private Lymph body;
    private IMonoLink < Lymph > location;
    @Override public void setData(Lymph obj) {
        body = obj;
    }
    @Override public Lymph getData() {
        return body;
    }
    @Override public void setNext(IMonoLink < Lymph > loc) {
        this.location = loc;
    }
    @Override public IMonoLink < Lymph > getNext() {
        return this.location;
    }
}
```


## Extending Generic Types

A non-final generic type can be extended.

Example 11.5 shows that the generic interface `IBiLink<E>` extends the generic interface `IMonoLink<E>`, and that the generic class `BiNode<E>` extends the generic class `MonoNode<E>` and implements the generic interface `IBiLink<E>` (see Figure 11.1).


```java
interface IBiLink<E> extends IMonoLink<E> {
  // ...
}
class BiNode<E> extends MonoNode<E> implements IBiLink<E> {
  // ...
}
```


The compiler checks that the formal type parameters of the superclass in the extends clause can be resolved.

In the case above, the formal type parameter E, which is specified for the subclass, is also used as the type parameter for the superclass and is used to constrain the interface to the same type parameter.

This dependency ensures that an invocation of the subclass will result in the same actual type parameter being used by the superclass and for the interface.


```java
BiNode<Integer> intBiNode = new BiNode<>(2020, null, null);
MonoNode<Integer> intMonoNode = intBiNode;        // (1)
Integer iRef = intMonoNode.getData();             // Integer with int value 2020
MonoNode<Number> numMonoNode = intBiNode;         // (2) Compile-time error!
```


The assignment at (1) is type-safe, as the parameterized class BiNode<Integer> is a subtype of the parameterized class MonoNode<Integer>.

It is important to note that the superclass and the subclass are parameterized with the same type parameter; otherwise, the subtype relationship between the superclass and the subclass does not hold.

We get a compile-time error at (2) because the parameterized class BiNode<Integer> is not a subtype of the parameterized class MonoNode<Number>.

Subtype relationships for generic types are discussed in a later section (p.579).


<!-- Comment: 

Explain to me subtype relationships for generic types that I should know

___

Subtyping relationships for generic types in Java are based on the concept of type compatibility between different parameterized types. Understanding these relationships is essential for working with generic classes and ensuring type safety. Here are the key subtype relationships for generic types that you should know:

1. **Covariant Subtyping:** Covariant subtyping is the most common subtype relationship for generic types. It states that if `TypeA` is a subtype of `TypeB`, then `GenericType<TypeA>` is a subtype of `GenericType<TypeB>`. This means that a parameterized type with a more specific type argument is considered a subtype of a parameterized type with a more general type argument. For example:

   ```java
   List<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
   List<Object> objects = strings; // Covariant subtyping
   ```

   In this example, `List<String>` is a subtype of `List<Object>`, allowing you to assign a `List<String>` to a variable of type `List<Object>`.

2. **Invariant Subtyping:** Invariant subtyping enforces strict type compatibility and does not allow any subtyping relationships between different parameterized types, even if their type arguments are related. For example, `List<String>` is not a subtype of `List<Object>`, and vice versa. Invariant subtyping ensures type safety by disallowing potentially unsafe conversions.

3. **Contravariant Subtyping:** Contravariant subtyping is less common in generic types and has specific use cases. It states that if `TypeA` is a supertype of `TypeB`, then `GenericType<TypeB>` is a subtype of `GenericType<TypeA>`. This means that a parameterized type with a more general type argument is considered a subtype of a parameterized type with a more specific type argument. Contravariant subtyping is denoted by using the `super` keyword in Java. An example of contravariant subtyping can be found in Java's `Comparator` interface:

   ```java
   Comparator<Object> objectComparator = (o1, o2) -> 0;
   Comparator<String> stringComparator = objectComparator; // Contravariant subtyping
   ```

   In this example, `Comparator<Object>` is a supertype of `Comparator<String>`, allowing you to assign a `Comparator<Object>` to a variable of type `Comparator<String>`.

It's important to note that understanding these subtype relationships is crucial for using generic types correctly and ensuring type safety. By considering these relationships, you can design your generic classes and methods to allow appropriate flexibility while maintaining type integrity.

Figure 11.1 Extending Generic Types

Example 11.5 Extending Generic Types


```java
interface IBiLink < T > extends IMonoLink < T > {
    void setPrevious(IBiLink < T > previous);
    IBiLink < T > getPrevious();
}

class BiNode < E > extends MonoNode < E > implements IBiLink < E > {
    private IBiLink < E > previous; // Reference to previous node

    BiNode(E data, IBiLink < E > next, IBiLink < E > previous) {
        super(data, next);
        this.previous = previous;
    }
    @Override public void setPrevious(IBiLink < E > previous) {
        this.previous = previous;
    }
    @Override public IBiLink < E > getPrevious() {
        return this.previous;
    }
    @Override public String toString() {
        return (this.previous == null ? "" : this.previous + ", ") +
            this.getData() +
            (this.getNext() == null ? "" : ", " + this.getNext());
    }
}
```


Example 11.5 showed examples of generic types being extended to create new generic subtypes.

We can extend a non-generic type to a generic subtype as well:

```java
class AbstractNode { /* ... */ }                      // A non-generic supertype
class SimpleNode<E> extends AbstractNode { /* ... */ }// A generic subtype
```

We can also extend concrete parameterized types to specialized non-generic subtypes:

```java
class IntegerBiNode extends BiNode < Integer > {      // A non-generic subtype
    IntegerBiNode(Integer data, IntegerBiNode next, IntegerBiNode previous) {
        super(data, next, previous);
    }
    //...
}
```

Note that a subtype can inherit only one parameterization of the same generic interface supertype.

Implementing or extending a parameterized type fixes the parameterization for the subtype and its supertypes.

In the declaration below, the subtype `WeirdNode<E>` tries to implement the interface `IMonoLink<Integer>`, but at the same time, it is a subtype of the interface `IMonoLink<E>` which the superclass Mono-Node<E> implements:

```java
class WeirdNode<E> extends MonoNode<E> implements IMonoLink<Integer> { // Error!
  //...
}
```

There is great flexibility in extending reference types, but care must be exercised to achieve the desired result.


## Raw Types and Unchecked Warnings

A generic type without its formal type parameters is called a raw type.

The raw type is the supertype of all parameterized types of the generic type.

For example, the raw type Node is the supertype of the parameterized types Node<String>, Node<Integer>, and Node<Node<String>>.

The last parameterized type is an example of a nested parameterization.

It means that a node of this type has a node of type Node<String> as data.


A parameterized type (e.g., Node<String>) is not a class.

Parameterized types are used by the compiler to check that objects created are used correctly in the program.

The parameterized types Node<String>, Node<Integer>, and Node<Node<String>> are all represented at runtime by their raw type Node.

In other words, the compiler does not create a new class for each parameterized type.

Only one class (Node) exists that has the name of the generic class (Node<E>), and the compiler generates only one class file (Node.class) with the Java bytecode for the generic class.


Only reference types (excluding array creation and enumerations) can be used in invocations of generic types.

A primitive type is not permitted as an actual type parameter, the reason being that values of primitive types have different sizes.

This would require different code being generated for each primitive type used as an actual type parameter, but there is only one implementation of a generic class in Java.


Generics are implemented in the compiler only.

The JVM is oblivious about the use of generic types.

It does not differentiate between Node<String> and Node<Integer>, and just knows about the class Node.

The compiler translates the generic class by a process known as `type erasure`; meaning that information about type parameters is erased and casts are inserted to make the program type-safe at runtime.

<!-- Comment:

Explain to me about "type erasure" in Java in simple terms

___

In Java, "type erasure" refers to a process where the specific types of objects and generic parameters are removed or "erased" during compilation. It is a feature of Java's generic types system.

When you use generics in Java, you can define classes, methods, or interfaces that can work with different types of objects. For example, you might have a class called `List` that can store a list of any type of objects.

However, during the compilation process, the Java compiler removes the specific type information and replaces it with a more general type or even the raw type. This means that the compiled code treats all objects in a generic type as if they were of a common type called the raw type.

For example, if you have a `List<String>` (a list that stores strings), the compiler erases the type information and treats it as a raw type `List`. This is done to maintain compatibility with older versions of Java that did not have generics.

The consequence of type erasure is that you lose the ability to access the specific type information at runtime. You cannot, for example, determine the actual type of the objects stored in a generic list. This limitation is due to the fact that the type information is erased during compilation.

To work around this limitation, Java uses techniques like casting and type checking to ensure type safety at compile-time. These mechanisms help catch potential type-related errors before the code is executed.

In summary, type erasure in Java is the process of removing specific type information from generic types during compilation, which allows for compatibility with older versions of Java. However, it also means that the specific type information is not available at runtime, requiring additional mechanisms for type safety.

-->

The compiler guarantees that casts added at compile time never fail at runtime, when the program compiles without any unchecked warnings.


It is possible to use a generic class by its raw type only, like a non-generic class, without specifying actual type parameters for its usage.

Example 11.6 illustrates mixing generic and non-generic code.

The compiler will issue an unchecked warning if such a use can be a potential problem at runtime.

Such usage is permitted for backward compatibility with legacy code, but is strongly advised against when writing new code.


The assignment at (5) in Example 11.6 shows that it is always possible to assign the reference value of a parameterized type to a reference of the raw type, as the latter is the supertype of the former.

However, the raw type reference can be used to violate the type-safety of the node at runtime, as shown at (6).

Calling a method on a node using the raw type reference results in an unchecked call warning by the compiler.

In this particular case, a String is set as the data of an Integer node.


```java
...
Node<Integer> intNode = new Node<>(2020, null);
Integer iRef = intNode.getData();       // Integer object with int value 2020
...
Node rawNode = intNode;                 // (5) Assigning to raw type always possible.
rawNode.setData("BOOM");                // (6) Unchecked call warning!
intNode = rawNode;                      // (7) Unchecked conversion warning!
iRef = intNode.getData();               // (8) ClassCastException!
iRef = rawNode.getData();               // (9) Compile-time error!
```


<!-- Comment:

Explain to me what's wrong with this code and how to fix it 


```java
...
Node<Integer> intNode = new Node<>(2020, null);
Integer iRef = intNode.getData();       // Integer object with int value 2020
...
Node rawNode = intNode;                 // (5) Assigning to raw type always possible.
rawNode.setData("BOOM");                // (6) Unchecked call warning!
intNode = rawNode;                      // (7) Unchecked conversion warning!
iRef = intNode.getData();               // (8) ClassCastException!
iRef = rawNode.getData();               // (9) Compile-time error!
```

___


In the given code, there are a few issues related to type safety and unchecked operations. Let's go through each problem and discuss how to fix it:

```java
Node rawNode = intNode;                 // (5) Assigning to raw type always possible.
rawNode.setData("BOOM");                // (6) Unchecked call warning!
intNode = rawNode;                      // (7) Unchecked conversion warning!
iRef = intNode.getData();               // (8) ClassCastException!
iRef = rawNode.getData();               // (9) Compile-time error!
```

1. **Issue at (5):** Assigning to a raw type (`Node rawNode = intNode;`) is allowed because raw types bypass type checking. However, this undermines the type safety provided by generics.

   **Solution:** Avoid using raw types. Instead, use the generic type consistently. Update the assignment to `Node<Integer>` to maintain type safety.

   ```java
   Node<Integer> rawNode = intNode;
   ```

2. **Issue at (6):** The call `rawNode.setData("BOOM")` results in an unchecked call warning because `rawNode` is a raw type, and the type of the argument is not known at compile-time.

   **Solution:** Use the generic type `Node<Integer>` to ensure type safety. Update the call to `setData` with an `Integer` argument.

   ```java
   rawNode.setData(42); // Assuming 42 is the desired Integer value, replace "BOOM" with 42 or any other valid Integer value.
   ```

3. **Issue at (7):** Assigning `rawNode` back to `intNode` results in an unchecked conversion warning because you're assigning a raw type (`rawNode`) to a parameterized type (`intNode`).

   **Solution:** Again, use the generic type consistently to maintain type safety. Update the assignment to `Node<Integer>`.

   ```java
   intNode = rawNode;
   ```

4. **Issue at (8):** After assigning `rawNode` to `intNode`, attempting to retrieve the data with `iRef = intNode.getData()` results in a `ClassCastException`. This is because `rawNode` may have a different type than `intNode`, and the type information is lost due to using raw types.

   **Solution:** Avoid using raw types and ensure consistency in the generic type. Use `Node<Integer>` consistently throughout.

   ```java
   iRef = intNode.getData();
   ```

5. **Issue at (9):** Trying to assign the result of `rawNode.getData()` directly to `iRef` causes a compile-time error. This is because the type of `rawNode.getData()` is unknown due to the usage of raw types.

   **Solution:** Avoid using raw types and ensure consistency in the generic type. Use `Node<Integer>` consistently throughout.

   ```java
   Integer data = rawNode.getData(); // Assign the result to a variable of type Integer.
   iRef = data; // Now assign the variable to iRef.
   ```

By following these solutions and consistently using the generic type `Node<Integer>`, you can ensure type safety and eliminate the mentioned issues.


-->


<!-- Comment:

Give me the full corrected code for the above

___

Here's the corrected code, addressing the issues mentioned earlier:

```java
Node<Integer> intNode = new Node<>(2020, null);
Integer iRef = intNode.getData();       // Integer object with int value 2020

Node<Integer> rawNode = intNode;        // Assigning to raw type always possible.
rawNode.setData(42);                    // Unchecked call warning!

intNode = rawNode;                      // Unchecked conversion warning!
iRef = intNode.getData();               // No ClassCastException anymore!

Integer data = rawNode.getData();       // Assign the result to a variable of type Integer.
iRef = data;                            // Now assign the variable to iRef.
```

In the corrected code, the generic type `Node<Integer>` is consistently used throughout. 

The raw type assignment is replaced with the appropriate generic type assignment (`Node<Integer> rawNode = intNode;`). 

The call to `setData` is updated to provide an `Integer` argument (`rawNode.setData(42)`). 

The assignment of `rawNode` to `intNode` is kept as is. 

Retrieving the data from `intNode` using `intNode.getData()` no longer results in a `ClassCastException`. 

Instead of directly assigning `rawNode.getData()` to `iRef`, the data is first assigned to a variable of type `Integer` (`data = rawNode.getData()`), and then `iRef` is assigned the value of `data` (`iRef = data`).

These changes ensure type safety and address the issues in the original code.

-->


Assigning the reference value of a raw type to a reference of the parameterized type results in an unchecked conversion warning from the compiler, as shown at (7).

If the node referred to by the raw type reference is not of type Integer, using it as a node of type Integer can lead to problems at runtime, as shown at (8).

The assignment at (8) is only type compatible, not type-safe, as its type-safety is compromised at (6) as explained above.

A ClassCastException is thrown at runtime, since an Integer was expected, but a String was returned by the getData() method.


The assignment at (9) does not compile because of type mismatch: Without the generic type information, the compiler infers that the call on the getData() method using the raw type reference rawNode can only return an Object, whereas the type of the variable on the left-hand side is Integer.


The class Preliminaries in Example 11.6 is shown compiled with the non-standard option `-Xlint:unchecked`.

The compiler recommends using this option when non-generic and generic code are mixed in this way.

The program compiles in spite of the unchecked warnings, and can be executed.

But all guarantees of type-safety are off in the face of unchecked warnings.

See also §11.11, p.613, which provides details on translation of generic code by type erasure.


Example 11.6 Unchecked Warnings

```java
// A client for the generic class Node<E> in Example 11.2, p. 568.
public class Preliminaries {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Node<Integer> intNode = new Node<>(2018, null);
    Integer iRef = intNode.getData();        // Integer object with int value 2018
    intNode.setData(2020);                   // Ok.
//  intNode.setData("TwentyTwenty");         // (1) Compile-time error!
    intNode.setNext(new Node<>(2019, null)); // (2020, (2019, null))
//  intNode.setNext(new Node<>("Hi", null)); // (2) Compile-time error!

    Node<String> strNode = new Node<>("Hi", null);
//  intNode = strNode;              // (3) Compile-time error!
    String str = strNode.getData(); // (4) No explicit cast necessary.

    Node rawNode = intNode;         // (5) Assigning to raw type always possible.
    rawNode.setData("BOOM");        // (6) Unchecked call warning!
    intNode = rawNode;              // (7) Unchecked conversion warning!
    iRef = intNode.getData();       // (8) ClassCastException!
//  iRef = rawNode.getData();       // (9) Compile-time error!
  }
}
```

Running the program:
